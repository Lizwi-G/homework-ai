Write down another three different ways in which 34 can be formed by combining two numbers. You have seen that there are different ways in which 34 can be formed by combining two numbers. The same is true for any other number. The English number name thirty-four and the number symbol 34 tell us one of the many ways in which 34 can be formed from two different numbers: they tell us that 34 = 30 + 4. Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 112016/12/15 12:17:23 PM 12 unit 1: Whole numbers 2. Look at the two parts given in each item below. Which number is formed by combining the two parts? Write the number name and the number symbol. (a) 40 and 7 (b) 60 and 3 (c) 30 and 8 (d) 80 and 4 The parts that are mentioned in the name of a number are called the place value parts.

Four hundred and sixty-seven can be written in symbols like this: 400 + 60 + 7 In the short number symbol 467, the 60 is written on top of the two zeros of the 400, and the 7 is written on top of the zero of the 60: 400 60 7 400 607 400 60 7 1. Write down the place value parts that make up the number two hundred and eighty-three. 2. Write the number symbol for two hundred and eighty-three. 3. Write the expanded notation for the number two hundred and eighty-three. 4. Write the number name for 836. 5. Write 836 in expanded notation. 6. Write down the place value parts that make up the number 836. The number symbol also tells us what the parts of the number are. Look at the number symbol 467, for example: The “4” tells us that 400 is one of the parts of 467. The symbol “6” tells us that 60 is one of the parts of 467. 400 67 460 7 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 132016/12/15 12:17:23 PM 14 unit 1: Whole numbers 7.

(b) How do you know that the “7” in 357 means 7, and not 70 or 700? (c) How do you know that the “7” in 735 means 700, and not 7 or 70? The “9” in 298 is in the place where the number of tens is shown. The “9” in 298 tells us that there are 9 tens in 298. 298 = 200 + 90 + 8 298 = 2 hundreds + 9 tens + 8 units We can say the place value of the “9” in 298 is tens. The “9” in 928 is in the place where the number of hundreds is shown. The “9” in 928 tells us that there are 9 hundreds in 928. 928 = 900 + 20 + 8 928 = 9 hundreds + 2 tens + 8 units We can say the place value of the “9” in 928 is hundreds. The “9” in 829 is in the place where the number of units is shown. The “9” in 829 tells us that there are 9 units in 829. 829 = 800 + 20 + 9 829 = 8 hundreds + 2 tens + 9 units We can say the place value of the “9” in 829 is units. 200 90 8 Place values hundredstensunits 298 900 20 8 hundredstensunits 92 8 800 20 9 hundredstensunits 8 29 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 142016/12/15 12:17:23 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 15 Note the following: • The number symbol for twenty-eight is 28 not 208. 208 is the number symbol for two hundred and eight. • The number symbol for one hundred and eighteen is 118 not 10 018 . • The number symbol for one hundred and twenty-four is 124, not 10024 or 100204. • The expanded notation for one hundred and twenty-four is 100 + 20 + 4. • The number name forty does not have a letter u.

For example, this sentence is false: A bird has eight legs. Sentences such as the following are called number sentences: If you add 3 to 10 you get the same as when you add 4 to 9. We can also write number sentences in symbols: 9 + 4 = 10 + 3 1. Which of the following sentences are true, and which are false? (a) Four apples and three apples, altogether, is seven apples. (b) Six apples and three apples, altogether, is ten apples. (c) Six apples and one apple, altogether, is seven apples. (d) Five apples and two apples, altogether, is seven apples. 2. (a) How much is 5 + 5? (b) How much is 5 + 4? (c) How much is 7 + 3? (d) How much is 7 + 5? (e) How much is 8 + 4? 3. Nathi says 5 cubes + 4 cubes is the same number of cubes as 7 cubes + 3 cubes. He writes 5 + 4 = 7 + 3. Is this true or false? 4. Mpho says 5 + 5 is the same number as 7 + 3. She writes 5 + 5 = 7 + 3. Is this true or false?

Keep the left-hand side the same and change the right-hand side. Then write two more true number sentences with the same left-hand side. Example: 5 + 3 = 6 + 4 is false. But 5 + 3 = 6 + 2 is true. 5 + 3 = 2 + 6 and 5 + 3 = 1 + 7 are also true number sentences. (a) 8 + 5 = 10 + 3 (b) 8 + 6 = 7 + 7 (c) 2 + 9 = 9 + 2 (d) 80 + 70 = 100 + 20 (e) 70 + 50 = 80 + 50 (f) 19 − 5 = 20 − 4 (g) 13 − 7 = 14 − 8 (h) 13 − 7 = 15 − 9 (i) 13 − 7 = 20 − 14 (j) 20 + 8 = 10 + 18 (k) 10 + 6 = 20 − 4 (l) 30 + 17 = 40 + 7 The number sentence 7 + 5 = 9 + 3 can also be said in words, for example in any of the following ways: The sum of 7 and 5 is equal to the sum of 9 and 3. If you add 5 to 7 you will get the same answer as when you add 3 to 9. Seven plus five is equal to nine plus three. 6. Write each of the following number sentences in words, in the three different ways shown above. (a) 7 + 9 = 10 + 6 (b) 13 + 7 = 15 + 5 (c) 19 − 5 = 20 − 6 (d) 5 + 3 + 6 = 6 + 5 + 3 (e) 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 7. Write each number sentence in symbols. (a) The difference between 10 and 3 is equal to the sum of 5 and 2. (b) If you subtract 8 from 13 you will get the same answer as when you subtract 10 from 15. (c) Ten plus four is equal to eight plus six. Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 192016/12/15 12:17:23 PM 20 unit 2: number sentenCes 2.2 Equivalence 1. (a) Ben picked 50 mangoes. Later he picked 30 more mangoes. How many mangoes did he pick altogether? (b) Sissy picked 30 mangoes in the morning. Later she picked 50 more mangoes. How many mangoes did she pick altogether? When you add 30 to 50 you get the same answer as when you add 50 to 30. We can write this number sentence in symbols: 50 + 30 = 30 + 50 When you add two numbers, it does not matter which one you take first. Lea, Ada and Piet have to calculate 20 + 30 + 50. Lea plans to first calculate 20 + 30 and then add 50 to the answer. Piet plans to first calculate 30 + 50 and then add the answer to 20. Ada plans to first calculate 20 + 50 and then add 30 to the answer. 2. (a) Do you think Lea and Piet will get the same answer? (b) Do you think Ada will also get the same answer? All over the world, people sometimes use brackets to indicate which calculations they plan to do first. Piet can write his plan like this: 20 + (30 + 50). Ada can write her plan like this: (20 + 50) + 30. 3. How can Lea write her plan? Adding 30 to 50 gives the same result as adding 50 to 30.

The brackets indicate which calculations must be done first. Do each calculation in the way the plan states. (a) (8 + 5) + 7 (b) 8 + (5 + 7) (c) 8 + (7 + 5) (d) (8 + 7) + 5 5. Which other plans can be followed to calculate 8 + 5 + 7? Read this before you answer question 6: In some cases in question 6, you may have to do the calculations to find out whether the two plans give the same result or not. The calculations given inside the brackets must be done first. 6. Which of the number sentences below are false? For each false number sentence, make a true number sentence by writing a different plan on the right-hand side. (a) (20 + 8) − 5 = 20 + (8 − 5) (b) (20 − 8) − 5 = (20 − 5) − 8 (c) (20 − 8) − 5 = 20 − (8 − 5) (d) (8 + 2) + (7 + 3) = (8 + 3) + (7 + 2) (e) (8 + 7) + (2 + 3) = (8 + 3) + (7 + 2) (f) (20 + 4) + (10 + 2) = (20 + 10) + (4 + 2) When you have to add many numbers, it does not matter where you start. 7.

How many eggs does she now have in total? 3.2 Add without counting If you always have to count to find facts like 7 + 5 = 12, it will always take you very long to do calculations. You have to learn to make addition and subtraction facts without counting! A good way to do that is to make new facts from facts that you already know. For example if you know that 35 + 2 = 37, it is easy to know that 35 + 3 = 38, because it is just 1 more. In this section you will learn different ways to form new facts from facts that you already know. 1. You know that 10 + 10 = 20. Try to use this fact to quickly find the answers to the following. Start from 10 + 10 = 20 in each case. (a) 8 + 12 (b) 10 + 13 (c) 9 + 11 (d) 7 + 13 An easy way to make a new addition fact from a fact that you know, is to shift part of one number to the other number, for example: 3 10 + 20 = 30 By shifting 3 from the 20 to the 10, you get the new fact 13 + 17 = 30. + 6 = 44 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 282016/12/15 12:17:24 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 29 2. (a) Shift 5 from the one 20 to the other 20 to make a new fact from 20 + 20 = 40. (b) Shift 3 to make another fact from 20 + 20 = 40. (c) Make three more facts from 20 + 20 = 40. 3. (a) Make three different facts from 10 + 5 = 15. (b) Make three different facts from 10 + 7 = 17. The examples below show another way how you can use an addition fact that you already know to build other addition facts. 15 + 15 = 30 + 1 + 1 + 2 16 + 16 = 32 15 + 15 = 30 − 1 − 1 14 + 15 = 29 15 + 15 = 30 + 3 − 1 + 2 18 + 14 = 32 4. Start with 20 + 10 = 30 and make ten other addition facts, all with answers different than 30. 5. Zweli knows that 8 + 8 = 16. How can he use this knowledge to find out how much 6 + 9 is? Here is a different way to find addition facts. To find out how much 37 + 8 is, you can fill up to 40 and then add what remains of the 8: You can describe your thinking by using an arrow: 37 + 3 → 40 + 5 = 45 By first adding 3 and then adding 5 you have added 8 in total. 6.

Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 372016/12/15 12:17:25 PM 38 unit 3: Whole numbers: ADDition AnD subtrACtion When you know an addition fact, you can easily find two subtraction facts. For example if you know that 35 + 85 = 120, you also know that 120 − 35 = 85 and 120 − 85 = 35. 6. In each case give the answer, and write two subtraction facts. Follow the above example of 35 + 85 = 120. (a) 40 + 50 (b) 300 + 600 (c) 30 + 50 (d) 200 + 700 One way to subtract is to ask yourself what must be added to the smaller number to make up the difference. For example, to calculate 160 − 70 you may ask yourself what must be added to 70 to get to 160, and first fill up to 100. It is like finding the missing numbers in number sentences: 70 + what number? → 100 + what number? = 160 When you have found the missing numbers, you can add them to get the final answer. 70 + 30 → 100 + 60 = 160 So, 160 − 70 = 30 + 60 which is 90. So 160 − 70 = 90 You can also subtract piece by piece, filling up to 100 first. For example, to calculate 130 − 80 you may think like this: 130 − 30 = 100. Now there is 50 more to subtract. 100 − 50 = 50 So, 130 − 80 = 50 The above thinking can also be described as follows: 130 − 30 → 100 − 50 = 50, so 130 − 80 = 50 0102030405060708090100110120 1201101009080706050403020100 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 382016/12/15 12:17:25 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 39 7.

(a) 260 + 90 (b) 280 + 70 (c) 170 + 60 (d) 670 + 150 You need not draw a number line when you add by filling up. You can just write as follows: 280 + 20 → 300 + 70 = 370, so 280 + 90 = 370 2.

You can calculate 940 − 380 by adding on to 380 until you reach 940, as shown here: 380 + 20 → 400 + 540 = 940 So 940 − 380 = 20 + 540, which is 560. You can also subtract by rounding off and compensating. For example, you can calculate 830 − 270 by first subtracting 300: 830 − 300 = 530 but you have now subtracted 30 too much. So you have to compensate by putting the 30 back: 530 + 30 = 560, so 830 − 270 = 560. it sometimes makes addition easier if you switch the numbers around.

For example, to calculate 720 − 450 you can think like this: 720 is 700 and 20 and 450 is 400 and 50. It is easy to subtract 400 from 700 but to subtract 50 from 20 creates a problem. To make it easier, you can replace 700 + 20 with 600 + 120. Then you can subtract 50 from 120 and 400 from 600. So, 720 = 600 + 120 and 450 = 400 + 50. Hence 720 − 450 = 600 − 400 + 120 − 50 = 200 + 70 = 270 Instead of the curly signs we may use brackets to indicate the plan to calculate 600 − 400 and 120 − 50 separately: 720 − 450 = (600 − 400) + (120 − 50) = 200 + 70 = 270 }} } Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 422016/12/15 12:17:25 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 43 7.

Write a short paragraph about it. 3.7 Round off and estimate It is often useful to quickly make approximate answers for calculations. Imagine you buy items for R34 and R58 and do not have time to accurately calculate R34 + R58. It can help you to know that you need to pay about R30 + R60, which is R90. 34 can be rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten, which is 30. 58 can be rounded off to 60. 55 is equally far from 50 and 60. People all over the world have agreed to round off “upwards” in a case like this, so 55 is normally rounded off to 60. 3040 5060 506055 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 432016/12/15 12:17:25 PM 44 unit 3: Whole numbers: ADDition AnD subtrACtion 678 rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten is 680. 678 can also be rounded off to the nearest multiple of hundred, which is 700. 634 rounded off to the nearest multiple of hundred is 600. 634 rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten is 630. 1.

The break down and build up method In a case such as 786 − 523, the break down and build up method is quite easy: 786 = 700 + 80 + 6 or 700 and 80 and 6. 523 = 500 + 20 + 3 or 500 and 20 and 3. 500 can be taken from 700 to give 200: 700 − 500 = 200 20 can be taken from 80 to give 60: 80 − 20 = 60 3 can be taken from 6 to give 3: 6 − 3 = 3 Hence 786 − 523 = 200 + 60 + 3, which is 263. 5. Use the break down and build up method to calculate each of the following. (a) 937 − 624 (b) 876 − 445 (c) 348 − 33 (d) 987 − 352 6. Do the calculations in question 5 with the filling-up method.

Each number is calculated from the previous number in the same way. Here are two examples of sequences that you already know: • When the teacher asks Sally to “count in fives”, she counts like this by adding 5 each time: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... • For the instruction “start at 1 and count on in fives”, Sally counts like this: 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, ... We use the following words and notation to write and to talk about sequences. For example, in the case of the first sequence above: 5, 10, 15, 20, ... We can also write the sequence in a table and indicate the position number, like this: Position number 1234567100 Sequence 510152025 2nd number4th number three dots means it goes on forever 1st number3rd number Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 522016/12/15 12:17:26 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 53 When learning about sequences, you will learn how to recognise patterns, describe patterns, and continue patterns.

Over the years, the son’s mother wrote down the father’s and the son’s ages in a table, like this: Age of son (years) 0123451220 Age of father (years) 303132333435 2. Describe any patterns that you can see in the table. (What is different and what remains the same?) 3. Complete the table. This means: (a) Work out how old the father will be when the son is 12. (b) Work out how old the father will be when the son is 20. We can describe the father and son’s ages in different ways: • In words: The father is always 30 years older than the son. • As a calculation plan (rule): Father’s age = Son’s age + 30 Although their ages change all the time, the calculation plan remains the same for all ages: Son’s age 1 2 3 4 ... 10 11 Father’s age 31 32 33 34 ... 40 41 • With a flow diagram, such as the one on the next page. +30+30+30+30+30+30 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 542016/12/15 12:17:26 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 55 Input numbers Son’s age Output numbers Father’s age Calculation plan (operator) 20 15 12 6 5 ? ? ? 36 35 + 30 This flow diagram shows that we must, for example, take the input number 5 and add 30 to it to give the output number 35. 4.

These sequences are all different, but they are the same in two ways: • In all the “tables” or sequences of multiples we add the same number (the multiple) to get the next number in the sequence. For example: 2 4 6 8 10 12 ... 3 6 9 12 15 18 ... +2+2+2+2+2+2 +3+3+3+3+3+3 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 582016/12/15 12:17:26 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 59 We can, for example, describe the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, ... by saying that we add 3 to each number to get the next number. So, we can also use it as a calculation plan. • The sequences of multiples all have the same kind of calculation plan (rule), namely multiplication only: Position no. 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... Multiple no. 2 4 6 8 10 12 ... Position no. 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... Multiple no. 3 6 9 12 15 18 ... So, we can describe the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, ... with a calculation plan: Multiple number = Position number × 3 So: multiple 100 = 100 × 3 = 300 4. (a) Calculate the next five numbers and the 100th number in each sequence. Describe your methods. Sequence A: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ... Sequence B: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ...

These clocks measured time based on how much water flowed from one container into the next. You are going to make a simple water clock. 1. Form groups of 4 to 6 learners. Each group will need the following: a plastic 2-litre bottle, a sharp knife or scissors, a tool with a sharp narrow point, a bottle or jug of water and a permanent marker. Step 1 Cut the body of the bottle in half. Step 2 Puncture the bottle top. The hole should not be smaller than this circle: Step 3 Screw the bottle top back on. Slip the top part of the bottle into the bottom part. Step 4 Pour water into the top half. As soon as the water starts to flow into the bottom half, one of the group members must start to count from 1 to 240. Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 772016/12/15 12:17:29 PM 78 unit 6: time Step 5 Use the permanent marker to mark how much water has flowed into the bottom half when 60, 120, 180 and 240 counts are reached. Step 6 Empty the top and bottom half of the bottle. Repeat steps 3 to 5. [source: http://www.wikihow.com/make-a- Water-Clock-(Clepsydra)] You can now use the water clock to measure the time it takes to do something in units of 60 counts. 2. Each group uses their water clock to measure how long one of the learners in the class can hold her or his breath. Compare the time taken according to the different water clocks. What do you notice? Explain why this is so. 3. Place all the water clocks next to each other. What do you notice about the marks you made earlier at 60, 120, 180 and 240? Counting is not a good way to measure time, because some people count faster than others. People decided long ago to use the changing of days to measure time. The sun appears each day, it disappears later, and it appears again the next day. The period of time that starts when the sun appears on one day, and ends when the sun appears on the next day, is called one day. The day is divided into 24 equal periods which are called hours. 1 day = 24 hours 1 hour = 60 minutes 1 minute = 60 seconds 4. For approximately how many minutes are you in school each day of the week? Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 782016/12/15 12:17:30 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 79 5. It takes Learner A 65 seconds to write ten words. It takes Learner B 1 minute and 5 seconds to write ten words. Who takes the longest to write ten words? 6. It takes Grandma 120 minutes to walk to the shop. It takes Grandpa 2 hours to walk to the shop. Who takes the longest? 6.3 Understanding the 12-hour clock This clock shows 12 hours. It measures the time from midnight to midday and from midday to midnight. The starting point (or the zero point) is at the top of the clock where the 12 is. The clock face is divided into 60 sections to show 60 minutes. The short hand is the hour hand. The long hand is the minute hand. The minute hand moves around the clock face once every 60 minutes. While the minute hand moves around the clock once, the hour hand moves to the next hour. One hour is the same length of time as 60 minutes. So: 15 minutes = 1 4 hour 30 minutes = 1 2 hour 45 minutes = 3 4 hour 1. Copy this circle. It has the same markings as the 12-hour clock above. Start counting the minutes at 12. Show where the markings are for the following number of minutes: (a) 10 minutes (b) 25 minutes (c) 40 minutes (d) three quarters of an hour (e) a quarter of an hour (f) half an hour Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 792016/12/15 12:17:30 PM 80 unit 6: time 2. What times do these clocks show? Write the time in numbers and in words, for example: 6:15 quarter past 6. (a) (b) (c) (d) Minutes past the hour As the minute hand moves from 12, at the top of the clock, we talk about minutes past the hour. We say: 1 minute past ..., 2 minutes past ..., 3 minutes past ... until we get to 30 minutes past, or half past the hour. 3. What times do these clocks show? Write the time in numbers and in words. (a) (b) (c) Minutes to the hour As the minute hand moves on past the 30 minute mark, we talk about minutes to the hour. We say 29 minutes to ..., 28 minutes to ..., 27 minutes to ... and so on, until we get to 1 minute to ... and then reach the next hour. 4.5. 6.7.8.9. 10. 11.12.13.14.15. 16.17.18. 19.20.21. 22. 23.

The 12-hour clock on the right shows half past four. The hour hand is halfway between 4 and 5. The minute hand is on 30 minutes. A digital clock is usually a 24-hour clock. The time on the 24-hour clock on the right is 04:30; this is 4 hours and 30 minutes after midnight or 4:30 a.m. If you wake up at six o’clock in the morning, the time on a 24-hour clock will show 06:00. This is the same as 6 a.m. If we have supper at six o’clock in the evening, the time on the 24-hour clock will show 18:00. This is the same as 6 p.m. On the 24-hour clock, midnight is 24:00. But because the new day begins at the same time as the old day ends, midnight is usually indicated as 00:00.

The measurements and other information about the fish will be our data to tell a story about a fish farmer. 7.1 Collect and organise data Jabu farms with goldfish. He sells the fish to people who keep them as pets. He has three kinds of goldfish: Huna (blue-grey), Hibuna (gold) and Syubunkin (spotty). Goldfish live up to 20 years and they require good care. Fish of different sizes have different prices. We are going to imagine we use data to help Jabu find the sizes of his goldfish. Huna goldfish Hibuna goldfish Syubunkin goldfish Jabu has 20 goldfish in Tank A. Imagine that they are the goldfish that you see on pages 88 and 89. You have to measure these goldfish and make a list of their measurements. Plan ahead Make a plan so that you will know which measurements are of Huna fish and which are of Hibuna fish. Plan how to measure accurately. Measure from the nose to the end of the body. Fish don’t keep their tails still, so you can’t measure their tails accurately! Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 862016/12/15 12:17:36 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 1] 87 1. Work with a classmate. (a) Decide how you will share the work and make sure that you do not leave out fish or measure them twice. Write down what you decided. (b) Now measure the fish and write down your measurements in your book. (c) Compare your measurements with another pair of classmates. If your measurements are not the same, discuss the reasons and write them down. (d) Measure again where you differed. Measure accurately. If you have new measurements, write them down. The measurements you made are called data. Data are measurements of a property that varies. The lengths of goldfish vary because the fish are not all the same age, and because they do not all eat exactly the same amount of food, and just because some fish grow faster and get bigger than others. The measurements you made may also be a little different from the measurements your classmates made, because you may not have been completely accurate. We must plan to be completely accurate when we gather data. 2. Jabu asks how long the fish in Tank A are. Which of sentences A to D below best describes the lengths of the Hibuna fish? A The Hibuna fish are not more than 8 cm long. B The Hibuna fish are all longer than 2 cm. C The Hibuna fish are between 2 cm and 8 cm long. D The Hibuna fish are between 2 cm and 8 cm long, but most are between 3 cm and 5 cm long. 3. Look at your measurements. Write a sentence to tell Jabu how big his Huna fish are.

In this case, part of the second number is added to reach the next multiple of 10: 6 768 + 2 → 6 770 (Step 1) Since 476 = 2 + 474, we must still add 474. Part of the 474 is now added on to reach the next multiple of 100: 6 768 + 2 → 6 770 + 30 → 6 800 (Step 2) Since 474 = 30 + 444, we must still add 444. Part of the 444 is added on to reach the next multiple of 1 000: 6 768 + 2 → 6 770 + 30 → 6 800 + 200 → 7 000 (Step 3) Since 444 = 200 + 244, there is still 244 to be added: 6 768 + 2 → 6 770 + 30 → 6 800 + 200 → 7 000 + 244 = 7 244 (Step 4) If you look back at the steps, you will notice that the 476 was broken down into four parts: 2 + 30 + 200 + 244 = 476 1. (a) What part of 476 was added on to 6 768 in Step 1? (b) What part of 476 was added on in Step 2? (c) What part of 476 was added on in Step 3? (d) What part of 476 was added on in Step 4? (e) The steps are shown on this number line. What are the numbers at the two red lines, and how far apart are they? 2. Use the filling-up method to calculate the following.

For example, 7 234 − 4 876 can be calculated by finding out how much should be added to 4 876 to reach 7 234, as shown below. We add on in steps from 4 876 until we reach 7 234, and then check how much we had to add on in total: 4 876 + 24 → 4 900 + 100 → 5 000 + 2 234 = 7 234. In total we added on 24 + 100 + 2 234 which is 2 358. So, 4 876 + 2 358 = 7 234 and 7 234 − 4 876 = 2 358. 3. Use the add-on method of subtraction to calculate the following. (a) 7 236 − 2 875 (b) 6 721 − 4 503 (c) 9 000 − 1 234 (d) 8 187 − 5 592 (e) 7 386 − 3 163 (f) 8 396 − 5 273 Add by adding on place value parts To calculate 3 465 + 4 574 the number that is to be added can be broken down into its place value parts. The place value parts can then be added one by one to the first number: 4 574 = 4 000 + 500 + 70 + 4 So, 3 465 + 4 574 = 3 465 + 4 000 + 500 + 70 + 4 and it can be calculated like this: 3 465 + 4 000 = 7 465 7 465 + 500 = 7 965 7 965 + 70 = 8 035 8 035 + 4 = 8 039 The work can also be shown like this: 3 465 + 4 000 → 7 465 + 500 → 7 965 + 70 → 8 035 + 4 = 8 039 Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 1322016/12/15 12:17:50 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 2] 133 4.

Give two examples from everyday life where you would measure: (a) length (b) distance (c) height (d) width (e) depth In all of the comparisons you made in question 1, you could only tell which object or distance is longer. You were not able to tell how much longer it was. 6. Which is longer, the pencil or the matchstick? It is quite easy to see that the pencil is longer than the matchstick. However, we need another way to compare them if we want to be more exact. Themba says: “The pencil is 4 times as long as the matchstick.” 7. (a) Is Themba correct? (b) How can you find out if Themba is correct, without using a ruler? (c) How can you find out if Themba is correct by using a ruler? Themba did this: Matchsticks are used above to measure the length of the pencil. We say that the matchstick is the unit of measurement. However, not all people will use a matchstick as a unit of measurement, or some people’s matchsticks may be shorter or longer than others. This means that different people will get different measurements for the same object. So we need a standard unit of measurement, which is a unit that everyone can use and that is always the same length.

That makes it possible for us to tell other people how long an object is. The system is called the International System of Units (SI). We call these units the standard units. They are the same everywhere in the world where they are used. 1. What is the difference between a standard unit and a unit that is not standard? Talk about this with a classmate. We use different instruments that are marked in standard units to measure the length of objects. Here are two of the instruments that we use to measure shorter lengths. Ruler Measuring tape Your teacher can show you another commonly used ruler. It is 1 m long and it is called a metre stick. In 1793, people in France decided that they would use the metre (m) as the standard unit for length. One metre is the standard and the other units are named for how they relate to the metre. A centimetre (cm) is one of the parts if 1 m is divided into 100 equal parts. There are 100 cm in 1 m. Centi- in centimetre means hundredth. 012345678910 100 cm = 1 m Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 1492016/12/15 12:17:55 PM 150 unit 4: lenGth A millimetre (mm) is one of the parts that is formed when 1 m is divided into 1 000 equal parts. There are 1 000 mm in 1 m. Milli- in millimetre means thousandth. There are 10 mm in 1 cm. A kilometre (km) is 1 000 times as long as 1 m. Kilo- in kilometre means thousand. 2. Which of the units will you use if you have to measure the length of each of these objects? (a) the length of your textbook (b) the length of the classroom (c) the thickness of your pencil (d) the distance between two towns Most rulers have centimetres (cm) and millimetres (mm) as their units. We use rulers to measure shorter lengths such as the length of a book or the length in a geometric figure. On measuring tapes you will see millimetres, centimetres and metres (m). We use measuring tapes to measure longer lengths, such as the height of a person or the length of a skirt. For even longer distances, such as the length of a wall in a building, there are builder’s tape measures and surveyor’s tape measures. Now look at the ruler below. There are 1 cm spaces on the ruler. 1 000 mm = 1 m 10 mm = 1 cm 1 000 m = 1 km 012345678910 1 cm1 cm1 cm Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 1502016/12/15 12:17:55 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 2] 151 Each centimetre space is divided into 10 equal smaller spaces. So every centimetre is divided into tenths of a centimetre. This means that the space of 1 cm is the same length as the space that is 10 mm long. You already know that 1 cm = 10 mm. 3. Name three objects that are about the length of a centimetre. (Hint: look at your hands or look around in the classroom.) 4. Name three objects that are about 10 cm long or wide. 5. Name three objects that are about 30 cm long or wide. 6. Name an object that is about 30 cm long and 20 cm wide. 7. Now use some of the objects that you named in questions 3 to 6 to help you estimate the following: (a) Estimate how long your thumb is. (b) Estimate how long your desk is. (c) Estimate how wide the distance is between two desks in your classroom. 4.3 Measuring short lengths accurately 1. Kholeka measures the length of the blue bar below. 012345678910 (a) Kholeka says the blue bar is 4 cm long. Is she correct? (b) If 4 cm is wrong, give the correct answer and explain to Kholeka what she did wrong. Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 1512016/12/15 12:17:55 PM 152 unit 4: lenGth 2.

Explain in your own words how you will measure the length of an object like the blue bar accurately. 4. What is the length of the green bar? 012345678910 The easy correct way to use the ruler is to put one end of the object that you measure on the 0 mark of the ruler. Read the measurement where the other end of the object is. 5. (a) What is the length of this red bar? 012345678910 (b) How did you find the answer?

(a) What is the length of this grey bar in millimetres? 012345678910 (b) What is the length of the grey bar in centimetres? We can also record the length of an object with a combination of two different units. The length of the grey bar in question 6 can be given as 5 cm and 5 mm, or 5 1 2 cm. 012345678910 The bar above is more than 5 cm but less than 6 cm long. It is 7 mm longer than 5 cm. We can therefore say that the bar is 5 cm and 7 mm. Or we can record it as 57 mm. 7. Discuss with one or two classmates why we can also record the length of the purple bar as 57 mm. 8.

Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 1562016/12/15 12:17:56 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 2] 157 A trundle wheel is a simple device for measuring distances that are too long for a tape measure, or that are not always in a straight line. It consists of a wheel with a scale around its edge. The wheel is attached to a long handle. You can push it along the path that you want to measure. Every time it completes a full turn, it makes a click. To use a trundle wheel to measure distances, you need to know what distance is covered if the wheel turns around once. 2. If your school has a trundle wheel, use it to measure some distances. First estimate the distance and then measure it. 3. Which instrument will you use to measure the following lengths or distances? (a) the length of the longest wall of your school building (b) the distance around a soccer field (c) the length of your pencil (d) the thickness of a toffee (e) the height of the door in your classroom 4.6 Rounding off In mathematics, we often round off numbers to numbers that are easy to work with. Rounding is a way of estimating. Numbers that are rounded off are approximations. An approximation is close to the exact number, a little more or a little less. A trundle wheel Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 1572016/12/15 12:17:57 PM 158 unit 4: lenGth Sometimes it is not necessary to give the exact number or measurement, even if it is possible. For example: The annual school fun walk has an exact distance of 5 km 346 m. If someone asked you the distance of the fun walk, you will probably answer (about) 5 km. 1. Discuss these questions with one or two classmates. (a) When do you think it would be a good thing to round off a number or a measurement? (b) When do you think it is necessary to give the exact number or quantity? 2. The newspaper said there were 30 000 people at the soccer game. Do you think that is the exact number of people that attended the game? To round a number usually means to find a multiple of 10, 100 or 1 000 that is close to the number. We say that we round up or down to the nearest 10 or 100 or 1 000. Examples: 142 is closer to 140 than to 150, so 142 rounded to the nearest 10 is 140. 147 is closer to 150 than to 140, so 147 rounded to the nearest 10 is 150. 145 is the same distance from 140 and 150. “Halfway” numbers are usually rounded up to the larger of the possibilities. So, 145 rounded to the nearest 10 is 150. 3.

When we count many objects, it can take a very long time and we may make mistakes! A better way is to first write down your thinking as a calculation plan. Write down what you are going to do. Then you can calculate the answer instead of counting. For example: Amir: Number of beads = 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 Mia: Number of beads = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 4 × 5 + 4 × 3 Thea: Number of beads = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 4 × 8 For each bracelet on the next page, write down your calculation plan to find out: (a) how many yellow beads there are (b) how many green beads there are (c) how many beads there are altogether. Note: Do not calculate now. The method (plan) is the important thing! You can calculate later or even use a calculator once you have written down your plans. A plan describes your method. You can write a plan in words, as a calculation plan or as a flow diagram. 4 × 5 + 4 × 3 and 4 × 8 and 5 + 3 etc. are calculation plans.

If we want to say that addition should be done first, we use brackets: 7 × (8 + 5) means 8 + 5 = 13 and 7 × 13 = 91. But 7 × (8 + 5) can also be replaced with 7 × 8 + 7 × 5, which can be calculated like this: 7 × 8 + 7 × 5 = 56 + 35 = 91 (5 + 7) × 8 means 5 + 7 = 12 and 12 × 8 = 96 6.

When you do question 1, you will see how you can find out how many peaches you can buy with R776, if each peach costs R3. 1. (a) How much is 3 × 200, and how much is 3 × 100? (b) If the peaches cost R3 each and you have R776, can you buy 200 peaches? (c) Can you buy another 100 peaches with the money that is left over? (d) Can you buy another 50 peaches? (e) How many peaches can you buy with the money that is left over from R776 after having bought 250 peaches? The work you have done for question 1 can be written up as shown below. To calculate 776 ÷ 3, you have to find out by what 3 must be multiplied to get 776. 3 × 200 = 600, so the answer is more than 200. 3 × 50 = 150 So 3 × 200 + 3 × 50 = 600 + 150 = 750. But there is still 26 left over because 776 − 750 = 26. 3 × 8 = 24 So 3 × 258 = 750 + 24 = 774, and 2 is left over. 776 ÷ 3 = 258 remainder 2 2.

She knows that 33 × 100 = 3 300, but this is 33 × 7 too much. Thembi now has to compensate. That means she has to make a correction. She has to subtract 33 × 7 from 33 × 100. 33 × 7 = 30 × 7 + 3 × 7 = 210 + 21 = 231. Now Thembi knows that 33 × 93 = 3 300 − 231 = 3 069 5.

How much money does he have left? Sometimes it is more difficult to see which calculations you must do, for example: Bettina spent R60 on food and then she had R80 left. How much money did she have before she bought the food? In a case like this, it may help to write a number sentence to understand what you must do. We can write: The money Bettina had − 60 = 80 A number sentence like this will help you to see that in this case you can calculate 80 + 60 to find out how much money Bettina had. 80 + 60 = 140 so she had R140. To check, you can put your answer into the number sentence: 140 − 60 = 80, so R140 is the right answer. 1. Answer the questions that you find easy. Skip the other questions. (a) Gwede has 60 goats.

(c) Find three things with a mass that is less than the mass of your Mathematics textbook. 3.2 Using a balance to compare mass We often decide which of two objects is heavier just by estimating how difficult it is to lift the objects. We can also compare mass by using a balance. You can make your own balance using a clothes hanger and two shopping bags. 1. Use your balance to find which has less mass: (a) your eraser or your pencil (b) 3 rulers or a sock (c) 3 rulers or 20 bottle tops Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 2982016/12/15 12:18:33 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 4] 299 2.

Compare your answers in questions 1 and 2 with the answers of some of your classmates. (a) Did you get the same answers? (b) Is everyone’s pencil the same size? (c) Did everyone use the same kind of rulers? (d) Did everyone use the same kind of bottle tops? If we want to measure how heavy something is, we need a unit. The unit you used in question 2 was bottle tops. If you used different kinds of bottle tops than your classmates, you cannot compare your measurements because your units were different. 3.3 Estimating and measuring mass in kilograms When mass measurements need to be accurate, we have to agree to compare the mass of all objects to the standard unit. The standard for mass measurement is one kilogram (kg). The mass of 1 ℓ of water is about 1 kg. 1. Fill a 1 ℓ plastic bottle with water and use it to estimate the mass of the following objects: (a) the heaviest book in the class (b) a shoe (c) a desk (d) a chair (e) your school bag (f) a pencil Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 2992016/12/15 12:18:33 PM 300 unit 3: mAss 2.

The bathroom scale is as accurate as the smallest mass it can measure. Estimate and write down the mass of the following objects. (a) a roll of tape (b) a hammer (c) a bottle of soap On the bathroom scale, the hammer, the roll of tape and the bottle of soap look as if they have the same mass. It looks as if their mass is nothing. Their mass is less than 1 kg. Their mass is too small to show on the bathroom scale. We need to use another instrument and another unit of measurement to find their mass.

(a) 1 kg and 500 g + 250 g → 1 kg and g + 250 g → kg + g + 250 g → kg + g + 250 g → kg + g + 250 g → kg + g + 250 g → kg (b) 2 kg and 800 g + 200 g → kg and g + 200 g → kg + g + 200 g → kg + g + 200 g → kg + g + 200 g → kg and g + 200 g → kg Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 3022016/12/15 12:18:35 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 4] 303 5. Copy the number lines below. Fill in the grams, or kilograms and grams, on your number lines. We can hardly feel the mass of 1 g. It is very difficult to estimate the mass of very light objects by holding them in your hand. 6. Collect objects that have a small mass that would be measured in grams, for example a pencil, a paper clip, an eraser, a sheet of paper or a coin. Estimate the mass of each in grams. 3.6 Measuring in grams and kilograms We can use kitchen scales to measure in grams and kilograms. Rulers and bathroom scales have 10 spaces between each numbered line. Some kitchen scales have 10 spaces between each numbered line. Other kitchen scales have fewer spaces between each numbered line. 0 kg1 kg 2 kg3 kg2 kg and 250 g 4 kg5 kg4 kg and 200 g if we work with estimates of measurements, our answers must always say “about so much”.

How many sweets will each child get if 120 sweets are shared equally between 5 children? If you know that 5 × 24 = 120, you know that each child will get 24 sweets and that no sweets will be left over. We can also say that 120 is divided into 5 equal parts. We write this as 120 ÷ 5 = 24. Multiplication can also be used to answer division questions like the following: How many children can each get 5 sweets from a packet of 180 sweets? If you know that 36 × 5 = 180, you know that 36 children can each get 5 sweets. We can also say that 180 is divided into 36 equal parts of 5 each.

Here is another way to say how big a box is: You may say how many square stickers or tiles are needed to cover the bottom or the “floor” of the box. This is called the floor area of the box. When people describe the size of a house or piece of land, they normally use the area rather than the perimeter.

A coin can only land on one of these. If you say “heads” when your teacher flips a coin, and it lands on HEADS, then you win. If it lands on TAILS, you lose. Flipping a coin helps us make some decisions. 12.1 How does it work to flip a coin? 1. (a) When two teams are playing each other, they agree to flip a coin to make a decision. The person who wins the toss starts the game. Do you think this is fair? Why do you say so? (b) What else do people use when they may not agree with each other and they have to make a fair decision? Discuss other ways of helping to make a decision, like drawing straws (the person who draws the short straw is usually the loser). Write down at least one other way. Sometimes people think they can predict which side the coin will land on. People think one side is luckier than the other side, or that one HEAD must be followed by one TAIL. We will do an experiment to better understand how it works to flip a coin. A coin has two sides called heADs and tAils. heADs is the side with the coat of arms of south Africa, and tAils is the side with the number that tells the value of the coin. We say a coin flip has two outcomes: either heADs or tAils. heADs tAils Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 3472016/12/15 12:18:46 PM 348 unit 12: ProbAbilitY 12.2 An experiment with flipping a coin Work on your own to flip a coin many times and record what happens each time. You need a sheet of squared paper and a coin. Make a key on your sheet of paper: HEADS TAILS Each time the coin lands HEADS up, shade in a square with your pencil. Each time the coin lands TAILS up, leave the block unshaded. Below is an example of 20 flips of a coin that were recorded by shading blocks: TH In the example above, the HEADS are 11 out of 20, and the TAILS are 9 out of 20. 1. Now do your own experiment. Flip a coin at least 20 times and record the results. If you have time, flip the coin 100 times. 2. Work with your own data. (a) How many flips did you do? (b) How many times did you get HEADS in your experiment? (c) What fraction of the flips was HEADS and what fraction of the flips was TAILS? 3. Compare your data with that of other classmates. (a) What fraction of HEADS did they get in their experiments? (b) Why do you think your data are not all the same? When you record the way the flipped coin landed, this is your data. We can analyse the data to understand coin flipping better. Maths_English_LB_Grade4_Book.indb 3482016/12/15 12:18:46 PM GrADe 4: mAthemAtiCs [term 4] 349 Sometimes people think the number of HEADS and the number of TAILS must be the same in any experiment. This is not true. Only when we flip a coin many, many, many times can we expect that the total number of HEADS and TAILS may be the same. We cannot expect that in short experiments. Why is this? 4. Work with the rest of the class. (a) Make a tally table with rows from 0 to 20 to show how many HEADS each classmate got out of 20 flips of a coin. (Nobody can get more than 20 HEADS in 20 flips.) (b) Make a pictograph. Draw a number line that runs from 0 to 20. Make a cross above the correct number to show how many HEADS each one got.

NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 42018/05/17 8:50:55 AM Welcome to Grade 4 Natural Sciences and Technology! Join the Quantum Club on an adventure to explore the world around us. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 52018/05/17 8:50:56 AM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hi there! My name is Mothusi. My favourite subjects at school are where I get to be creative and imaginative. But, did you know, this is not only in the art or drama classroom? We can also be creative in the ways we do Science and Technology. This is especially true when thinking about new ways to answer a question with a Science investigation or drawing a design to solve a problem. I also really love being outdoors in the natural world around me. This is why I am going to go through Life and Living with you. I think we are very lucky to live in such a beautiful place as South Africa, with so many colours and plants and animals. I am really excited to start learning more about the living world around us. Felicity is my best friend and she teaches me how to think carefully and solve problems using logic, which is a very good skill to have in Science. Although we can get on each other’s nerves, just like best friends do, we have so much fun together and learn a lot from each other. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 62018/05/17 8:50:59 AM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hey! My name is Walt. I have two places where I am most happy! The first is in the Science lab because this is where we get to be inventive and tinker away with projects and experiments! My second favourite place is the junk yard! Do you know how many interesting objects you can find there? I use these objects in my latest inventions. This is why I am really excited to be going through Matter and Materials with you. We are going to learn about all sorts of materials around us, and especially how to strengthen materials and make strong structures. I also really enjoy Maths and thinking about how we can solve problems logically. Phumlani is one of my best mates, although he can be very messy at times! But, Phumlani helps me get involved with my whole body when trying to solve problems in our daily lives, and not just use my mind. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 72018/05/17 8:51:00 AM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. What’s up! My name is Phumlani. I just want to dive straight into this year, and especially Natural Sciences and Technology. Sometimes though, I find it hard to sit still in class as I just want to get up and do things! My teacher often says I have too much energy and I battle to sit still in class. Maybe that’s why I am going through Energy and Change with you this year. I am really looking forward to understanding what “energy” really is! And, we also get to make a musical instrument this year. The best part about Natural Sciences and Technology is that we get to learn actively. We have goals and questions that we want to answer and I am always the first to leap into action! Walt and I make a very good team because he is very good at thinking and planning, and then following a method. But I think I can also help as sometimes Walt wants to think too much, whereas in Science and Technology you also have to get involved in the subject and start experimenting. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 82018/05/17 8:51:02 AM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hello! My name is Felicity. One of my favourite places to be is in the school library. I love reading a new book – there is just so much to learn and discover about our world! I am always asking questions. Often these questions do not yet have answers to them! This is fascinating as we then get to make a theory about what we think the answer might be. This is why I really enjoy learning about outer space as there is so much that we do not know. Throughout history people have been asking questions about space and our place in the universe. This is why I am going to go through Earth and Beyond and Systems and Control with you as we start to learn about our planet Earth and our solar system. I also like expressing my opinion and debating about a topic. You have to give me a very good argument to convince me of your opinion! I love exploring with Mothusi, as she helps me to be more creative and imaginative in the way that I think. I can also be quite sceptical and do not believe everything I read. But, this is very important in Science as we must not always accept everything as fact.

What does it mean to be non-living? • A river seems to move, so is a river living? • Are the plants that I eat from Gogo’s garden living or non-living? • How can I tell if the bean seeds from Gogo’s garden are living or non-living? • A chicken egg seems to be non-living, but then it can hatch into a chicken. Is the egg living or non- living? 1.1 Living things There are many different kinds of living things. It is easy to see when some things are living or non-living. It is a bit trickier to decide with other things if they are living or not. ACTIVITY 1.1: What is living and what is non-living? INSTRUCTIONS (What you must do): 1. Look through the photos on page 5. Decide whether you think they are living or non-living. 2. Put a ✓ next to the living things and a ✗ next to the non-living things. 3. When you are done, discuss your choices with your class. New words • process • conditions • oxygen gas • carbon dioxide gas • seedling • excreting waste products • transpiration • sensing • reproducing • germinate • fertilise • dormant NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 42018/05/17 8:51:04 AM 5Chapter 1: Living and non-living things5 Flowers and plants Water and waves 1 A zebra Clouds in the sky 2 Chicken eggs in a nest 3 A burning fire 4 A tropical fish 5 Mould growing on a lemon 6 NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 52018/05/17 8:51:05 AM Life and living6 It is not always easy to say if something is living or non- living. Many times things that look as if they are non-living can become alive again. Other things like a river or soil, are non-living but people say the “soil is alive” or talk about “living waters”. This is because there are so many living things that live in the soil or the water. This can be a bit confusing, don’t you think? Look carefully at the living things in the photos on page 5. Can you see what is the same in all of them? Something that they maybe all do? Characteristics of living plants and animals Although living things look different, they all carry out seven similar processes. We call these the seven life processes. Let’s take a look at each of these life processes. Moving All living plants and animals move: • Humans and animals use their bodies to move from one place to another. • Some plants turn towards light or water. Roots mostly grow downwards. Many stems grow upwards. Sunflowers turn towards Humans move all the time. the sun. These athletes are running. 7 Did you know? It is ok if you do not agree with everyone else. It is important that you listen to everyone when they explain what they think it means to be living or non-living.

A mother and father with their baby. Sensing All living things respond to any change that they sense: • When you feel cold, you put on a jersey or jacket. • When it becomes winter some animals hibernate. • In autumn the leaves on some trees change colour. • You can use an umbrella to protect you from the rain or from the harsh sun on a hot day. • Reptiles lie and bask in the sun on cold days. This chameleon is basking on The leaves on some trees the wall in the winter sun. respond to the change of the season and turn brown during autumn. Visit Video on hibernation. goo.gl/dhT4X NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 72018/05/17 8:51:06 AM Life and living8 Breathing All living things breathe gases in and out: • Humans and animals use oxygen gas from the air that they breathe in. They release (give off) carbon dioxide gas when they breathe out. • Plants take the gas carbon dioxide into their leaves. They use it to make food. They then release oxygen for animals and humans to use. Feeding All living animals and plants need food: • Food gives all living things the energy they need. • Green plants can make their own food for energy in their leaves and stems. • Humans and animals eat plants to get energy. These children are eating their lunch. 8 Excreting All living things have to get rid of waste products: • Humans and animals have to get rid of waste products from their bodies. • There are special organs in the body which help to get rid of waste, such as the lungs, kidneys and skin. Your kidneys take the waste out of your blood and produce urine. • Plants get rid of waste water through the process of transpiration. Did you know? When you sweat you are actually excreting waste from your skin! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 82018/05/17 8:51:06 AM 9Chapter 1: Living and non-living things9 Do you see how shiny the horse looks? It is sweating from all the running. 9 Growing All living things grow: • Human and animal babies grow into adults. • Seedlings grow into plants. Growing seedling All seven of the life processes must happen for something to be living. If something does not carry out all seven life processes then that thing is non-living. For example, if you think of a river, you may think it moves and grows, but a river does not sense, feed, excrete, breathe or reproduce. So it is non-living.

INSTRUCTIONS (What you must do): 1. Look carefully at each photo. 2. Next to each of the seven life processes make a ✓ if it applies to the object in that photo. 3. If a life process does not apply to the object in the photo, make a ✗ next to that life process. 4. Decide whether the object is living or non-living and write your answer in the last column. 5.

I want to find out more! Some things seem to be non-living for a very long time. They wait until they sense the right conditions to revive again. This means that they have to wait for something special to happen before they can revive and show the characteristics of living things. We say they need the right conditions to revive and show the seven life processes. Look at the pictures below of seeds that seem to be non-living. Seeds from a coral tree 16 Have you ever eaten sunflower seeds? 17 Did you know? In the Western Cape some fynbos seeds wait for many years in the soil. They only start growing after a fire has burnt their hard outer shell. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 122018/05/17 8:51:07 AM 13Chapter 1: Living and non-living things13 QUESTIONS Why do seeds seem to be non-living? How can we show that they are living? We say the seeds are in a dormant state until they are given water, warmth, air, light and soil to germinate and start growing. There are other things too that seem to be non-living. Under the right conditions they can revive and carry on living. A dove keeping her eggs warm to hatch them. Fertilised eggs need to be kept warm or they will not hatch. This is why a mother bird will sit on her eggs to keep them warm after she has laid them. Yeast causes bread dough or cake batter to rise. Yeast needs warmth to come alive and start raising the bread. Some people buy dry yeast for their baking. It also needs heat to start working (and sugar). That is why you will see bakers place their dough in a warm place (near the stove for example) to get it to rise. Did you know? Not all eggs can grow into little birds. Only fertilised eggs can hatch. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 132018/05/17 8:51:07 AM Life and living14 ACTIVITY 1.3: Can I revive living things that seem to be non-living? INSTRUCTIONS: Look at these photos carefully. Chicken eggs hatching Frog eggs about to hatch in an incubator. 18 into tadpoles. 19 Shark eggs 20 Snake eggs hatching in a nest. 21 QUESTIONS: 1. Study the photo of the bird sitting on her nest on page 13. Can you explain why she needs to sit on her eggs? 2. In farms, the farmers often do not let the mother chickens sit on their eggs. Instead they put the eggs in an incubator, as you see in the picture above of the chicken eggs hatching. What does the incubator provide for the eggs? 3. A snake normally lays her eggs in a nest. Why does she not have to lie on top of them to hatch them? Did you know? A shark egg often looks like a see- through packet. Some people find them washed up on the beach and call them mermaid’s purses! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 142018/05/17 8:51:07 AM 15Chapter 1: Living and non-living things15 4. Have you ever caught tadpoles or kept silkworms in a box? Maybe someone in your class has some that they can bring to school. In what season can you normally find little tadpoles or silkworms, and why? ACTIVITY 1.4: Germinating a seed MATERIALS (What you need): • Bean seeds • Cotton wool • Plastic lids (From empty peanut butter jars, for example.) INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Place two layers of cotton wool in the plastic lid. 2. Place a few of your seeds between the two layers of cotton wool. 3. Drizzle water over the seeds. You need to water the cotton wool enough to wet it but not to drown the seeds. There should be no water running over the sides of the lid. 4. Place your seeds in a sunny place near a window. 5. Water your seeds whenever you feel the cotton wool is almost dry. Be careful not to drown your seeds. QUESTIONS: 1. Before you water your seeds, describe how your seeds look and feel. 2. Draw your seeds between the cotton wool on the first day in your exercise books. 3. Keep watching your seeds every day. How long did it take them to germinate? 4. What do your seeds look like? Draw more pictures. 5. What do you think made your seeds revive and germinate? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 152018/05/17 8:51:07 AM Life and living16 ACTIVITY 1.5: Getting yeast to grow! MATERIALS (What you need): • Packet of dry yeast • Sugar • Warm water • Empty yogurt tub INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Place a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of dry yeast in your yogurt tub. Mix with your spoon. 2. Add three teaspoons of warm water. 3. Stir your sugar and yeast mixture in the warm water to make sure it is well mixed. 4. Watch to see what will happen. SAFETY WARNING! Do not use boiling water – it might burn you! You only need to use luke warm water. QUESTIONS: 1. What did your yeast look and feel like before you mixed it with the sugar and water? 2. When you add the sugar to the yeast, does anything change in the yeast? 3. What happened to the yeast and sugar mixture when you added the warm water? 4. How did the yeast revive? 1.2 Non-living things Non-living things are different from living things because they do not perform all of the seven life processes. Let’s look at an example. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 162018/05/17 8:51:07 AM 17Chapter 1: Living and non-living things17 ACTIVITY 1.6: Do you think this car is living or non-living? INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Let’s look which of the seven life processes the car carries out. (Remember if it is not an egg or a seed. If there is even one life process that something cannot do then it is not living.) 2. Place a ✓ or a ✗ in the last column. Movement Reproducing Sensing Feeding Breathing Excreting Growing QUESTIONS: 1. How many life processes does a car have? 2. Is it living or non-living? Remember, non-living things cannot carry out all the seven life processes. Changing from living to non-living Living things can become non-living when they die. Look at the wood that your desk is made of. Where did the wood come from? What was once living? QUESTIONS Look around you in your class. Are there other things that were once living and that are now non-living or dead? Discuss these things in your class and write some of your answers from the discussion in your exercise books. Car 22 NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 172018/05/17 8:51:08 AM Life and living18 ACTIVITY 1.7: Distinguish between living and non-living things The reason for doing this activity is to help you learn to distinguish between living and non-living things. MATERIALS (What you need): • Collect three to five different objects or pictures of things that are living or non-living, and bring these to school. • Scrap paper or cardboard INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Divide into groups of three or four. 2. Use the scrap paper or cardboard to make four labels of these headings: • Living • Once lived • Seems to be non-living but can be revived • Never lived 3. Show the pictures or objects you brought to your group. Place each item or picture under one of the headings. 4. Now copy and complete the table below in your exercise books with the results. If there is time left over you can add in interesting objects from other groups into your table as well. LivingOnce livedCan be revived Never lived NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 182018/05/17 8:51:08 AM 19Chapter 1: Living and non-living things19 5. Carefully look at these photos. Say which are living or non-living, or which was once living or can be revived. Write the items in the table in your exercise book. Dog 23 Traffic light 24 Eggs 25 Burning fire 26 Trees 27 Paper 28 Dolphin 29 Computer 30 Skull 31 Fossil 32 Yeast in a packet 33 Duckling NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 192018/05/17 8:51:08 AM Life and living20 QUESTIONS Can you now distinguish between living and non-living things? How do you know when things are living and when they are not? Distinguishing between living and non-living Now you know that we can group almost everything in the world into two groups: living and non-living things. If something cannot carry out all the seven life processes then it is non-living. Some things were never living, like water and oxygen. Other things can be non-living now but were living before, like wood, fossils or oil. KEY CONCEPTS • We can group things on Earth as either living and non-living. • There are seven life processes that all living things carry out. • Non-living things cannot carry out all seven life processes. • Living things can die. • Some things like seeds or eggs seem to be non- living but they can revive again. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 202018/05/17 8:51:08 AM 21Chapter 1: Living and non-living things21 REVISION Read the story and answer the questions that follow. The Strelitzias When the world was made the Strelitzia birds were among the finest! Their bright orange feathers and dark purple wings decorated the sky and all creation admired their beauty. They would fly for hours high in the sky and only came down to feed at the river bed, and to tell the other animals of the wonderful things they had seen. Their nests were in the highest cliffs and they almost never sat in trees or walked on the ground among the other animals. However as time went by the Strelitzia birds became more and more proud and arrogant. They started to look down on the other animals. The birds teased them endlessly, telling the tall giraffe that her neck could never dream of the cool breezes they have felt. Or laughing at the tortoise who had to always stagger through the dust over rocks and sand. They laughed at the crocodile who had to stay in the water and at the monkeys for being stuck in trees all their lives. One day the Maker came to visit the animals and instead of the beautiful, joyous creation there was only sadness and tears. One by one the animals told of the Strelitzia birds’ teasing and taunting till the Maker became very angry at these proud birds. The Maker snatched them one by one from the sky and stuck their strong, slender legs deep into the soil. Their graceful long claws became roots and their feathers and wings turned into dull green leaves. Only their crowning feathers of orange and purple remained as a reminder of their beauty. If you find a Strelitzia flower today, look carefully and you will see how they are always reaching for the sky, trying to free themselves from the soil and fly once more! Strelitzia flowers reaching up! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 212018/05/17 8:51:08 AM Life and living22 QUESTIONS: 1. Name five non-living things mentioned in the story. 2. Name all the things from the story that use oxygen. 3. What life process in living things uses oxygen? 4. Give an example from the story of: a. moving b. sensing c. feeding d. growing 5. The Strelitzia birds had nests high up on the cliffs. Why do you think birds like them like to build their nests high up on the cliffs? 6. What life process do we think of with the eggs in the nest? 7. Do you think this story is true or not? Explain your answer. Now that we have learned about living and non-living things, let’s move on and take a closer look at plants and animals! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 222018/05/17 8:51:08 AM 23 2 Structure of plants and animals KEY QUESTIONS • Are plants all made in the same way with the same parts? • If I cannot see leaves on a cactus, is it still a plant? • Is the moss that grows near the tap at the back of the house a plant? How can I tell if it is? • So if a cactus, seaweed and a dandelion are all so different, how can you say they are all plants? • Animals all look so different – how can we group different animals together? • What makes animals different from each other? We learnt that almost everything can be grouped into two groups – living and non-living. In the next section we are going to learn more about living plants and animals, how they look and what makes them special. 2.1 Structure of plants Basic structures of plants All plants have different parts that we call structures. In most plants you can identify the following structures: • roots • stems • leaves • flowers Let’s take a look at the different plant structures. Roots Plant roots are normally found underground. Roots have very important functions (jobs): • Roots anchor or hold the plant in the ground. New words • structures • functions • absorb • nutrients • veins • compare • parallel • serrated edge NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 232018/05/17 8:51:09 AM Life and living24 • Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil, which are then transported to the rest of the plant. • Some plants store the food they make in their roots, like potatoes or carrots. Next year you will see how plants make their own food. The roots of this tree go deep A carrot is a root that stores down into the soil. food made by the plant. Stems Stems connect the roots to the rest of the plant. The stem has important functions: • The stem supports the leaves, flowers and fruit by holding these parts upright. • The stem carries nutrients and water from the roots to the other structures of the plant. • Some plants store the food they produce in their stems, like sugar cane or asparagus. A growing plant stem. 1 A tomato plant stem. Leaves Although many plant leaves are green, leaves can have many other colours. Some leaves change colour during autumn. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 242018/05/17 8:51:09 AM 25Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals25 Leaves have very important functions: • The leaves absorb the sunlight and use it to make food for the plant. • Some plants use their leaves to store water (like a cactus) or food (like spinach or lettuce). • Most leaves have veins that are like tiny pipes, which carry water and nutrients from the roots. The veins also carry the food the leaf makes to the rest of the plant. Can you see the veins in these leaves? 2 Flowers Many plants have flowers. The flowers are very important to the plant: • They make pollen to make seeds that will grow into new plants. • The flowers attract birds and insects to spread their pollen and get pollen from other flowers. • The flowers make fruit and seeds. • There are different kinds of flowers. QUESTIONS 1. Think of some of the flowers you know and write their names in your exercise books. 2. How many different colour flowers are in your school ground or your garden at home? Or do you see any flowers on your way to school? Next time look out for them and notice all the different colours! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 252018/05/17 8:51:09 AM Life and living26 Wow, flowers really make our lives more colourful, and I love colour! Seeds Many plants make seeds and store their seeds in different ways: • In their fruit like in peaches or oranges. • In pods like in beans and peas. • On a cob like a mielie or on an ear like wheat. Plants grow their seeds from the plant’s flower, like a dandelion or the acorns on an oak tree. Seeds are very important to plants because new plants can grow from seeds.

The seeds on ears of wheat. Pea seeds in a pod. Peach seeds are inside the fruit. ACTIVITY 2.1: Identifying the different parts of a flowering plant The reason for doing this activity is to see whether you can identify the different parts of a plant. MATERIALS: • Drawing of a flowering plant • Ruler, pencil and eraser INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the drawing on page 28. There are no labels added to the drawing. Scientists often need to label drawings and diagrams. This is a very important skill. 2. When we give labels for a drawing, there are some guidelines to follow: a. Draw a straight line with a pencil and ruler from the part that you want to label. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 272018/05/17 8:51:10 AM Life and living28 b. Label lines must touch the part of the drawing being labelled. c. The line must be parallel to the bottom of your page. d. Write the names for each part neatly underneath each other. 3. Draw the flowering plant below in your exercise books. 4. Label the drawing with the following labels: root, stem, leaf, flower, seed. Remember to follow the guidelines for labelling drawings. 5. When doing a scientific drawing, you need to give it a heading so that we know exactly what it is. Think of a heading for your drawing and write it in your exercise book. QUESTIONS: 1. Can you briefly describe the basic structures of a plant? 2. Do you think one part of a plant is more important than another part? Explain your answer. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 282018/05/17 8:51:10 AM 29Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals29 Visible differences between plants There are many different kinds of plants. If you look at different plants you can see many things that are different but also things that are the same. We know that most plants have stems, roots and leaves, and that many others have flowers, seeds and fruit. If we want to compare plants, we can compare these plant structures. You can look at the different plant structures of plants and compare their: • size • colour • shape Or you can ask important questions about the plants: • Does this plant make flowers? • Does it lose its leaves in autumn? • Can animals eat the plant or parts of the plant? • Can humans eat the plant? Perhaps you can think of other important questions that you could ask? QUESTIONS People have studied plants for thousands of years. Can you think of reasons why people need to study plants? Think of the reasons why people use plants and write them down. People that study plants, like you are doing, start by looking at the plants and comparing what they see. They later move onto more complicated things to compare. We are going to compare different plants using our eyes as our guides. Look at the photos of the banana palm and basil plant on page 30. How many differences can you see between these two plants? Did you know? You can easily start your own vegetable garden at home or at school. Bring your different crops to school to compare the differences in the food we eat. Did you know? All plants are grouped into two main groups – those with seeds and those without seeds. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 292018/05/17 8:51:10 AM Life and living30 Banana palm 3 Basil plant QUESTIONS Describe the differences you could list between the banana palm and basil plant. When we compare plants, it is sometimes easier to use the different plant structures to compare the plants. We can look at the stem, for example, in the banana palm and the basil plant and compare this. The basil plant has a thin green stem while the banana palm has a thick brown woody bark covering its very thick trunk. Look at the photo below of the edge of a river. There are two main types of plants growing: the waterlilies in the front and the reeds at the back. Both grow near or in water but they look completely different. Waterlilies and reeds growing in water. Did you know? Basil is a very popular herb used in cooking. Especially in pasta and pizza dishes! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 302018/05/17 8:51:10 AM 31Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals31 ACTIVITY 2.2: Comparing plants INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work with a friend and study the photo on page 30. Compare the two plants (water lilies and reeds) using the plant structures. 2. When people compare different things using a set of items (like the plant structures we are using), they often use a table to write down their ideas. 3. Study the table below. Copy the table in your exercise books. Write down the differences and similarities between the plant structures of the waterlilies and the reeds. Plant structureWaterliliesReeds Stems Roots Leaves Flowers and/or seeds QUESTION: If you look at a plant and cannot see seeds, can you say that that plant falls into the group that does not make seeds? Why not? Did you notice that it was slightly easier to compare plants if you know the different plant structures? In the next activity we are going compare the leaves of different plants. You need to collect three leaves from three different plants. It is important that you only bring leaves from plants that you or your parents know because you need to tell the class the name of the plant. Did you know? Some plants can hurt or poison you. Only collect leaves from plants that you know are safe to touch or even eat. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 312018/05/17 8:51:10 AM Life and living32 ACTIVITY 2.3: What do leaves of different plants look like? The reason for doing this activity is to see the difference in leaves from various plants. MATERIALS: • Leaves from three different plants. • The names of the plants you collected the leaves from. • White paper and crayons INSTRUCTIONS: How to make leaf rubbings: 1. Take one leaf and put it on a flat hard surface. 2. Make sure the veins are facing up (leaf must be upside-down). 3. Place the white paper over the leaf. 4. Use the crayon on its side to gently colour on the paper over the leaf to trace the leaf. 5. Label the leaf with the name of the plant it came from. 6. Repeat this process with all the leaves. 7. Give your page a heading that describes what you did. 8. After you have made the leaf rubbings, study your different leaves. Describe the differences you have noticed in the leaves. QUESTIONS: 1. Work with a friend and compare leaf rubbings. a. Can you see if different leaves have similar shapes? b. Can you see if different leaves have similar edges? 2. Copy the table below in your exercise books. 3. Draw the different shapes and edges of the leaves that you could see. Different shapes of leavesDifferent edges of leaves NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 322018/05/17 8:51:10 AM 33Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals33 4. Copy and complete the table in your exercise books. a. Fill in the name of each plant in the first column. b. Make a ✓ in the column(s) that describe how the leaf looks. c.

Name of plantRound leafLong, thin leafSmooth edgeSerrated edge Rose ✓✓ 2.2 Structure of animals All living things can be grouped into two groups – plants and animals. Plants can be compared using the different plant structures to group them into different groups. We can use a similar method to compare animals. In this section we are going to learn how to identify different animal structures. Then we will use these animal structures to compare some animals you might already know. Gogo’s beautiful roses New words • classify • vertebrate • invertebrate • mammal • reptile • amphibian • limb • sense organ • predator • prey NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 332018/05/17 8:51:11 AM Life and living34 ACTIVITY 2.4: Comparing animals INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Study the photos of the dogs and the jellyfish below. What differences and similarities can you see? 2. Copy the table in your exercise books and write down the differences and similarities. 3. Discuss your list of similarities and differences with your classmates and see how your lists are the same or different. Maybe you have some extra things to add to your list? DifferencesSimilarities A jack russel standing Jelly fish live in the sea. 4 and a golden retriever lying down. Did you know? Animals are classified (grouped) into those with a backbone (spine) and those without. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Those without a backbone are called invertebrates. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 342018/05/17 8:51:11 AM 35Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals35 Basic structures in animals Let’s take a closer look at the body parts of animals. Just like plants, animals also have a basic structure. The basic structures of an animal are: • head • tail • body • limbs • sense organs Head Animals all have a special part in their bodies called the head. Even the smallest animal has a part where its brain is. In most animals the head has these structures: • A brain – no matter how small. • Sensory organs like the eyes and ears. • Feeding structures like the mouth and jaws. Tail Most animals have a tail at the back end of their body. Have you ever wondered where the tail of a starfish or octopus is? A tail is usually pointed but can have other shapes too. ACTIVITY 2.5: The tails INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in groups and look at the different tails of all the animals in the drawing on page 36. 2. Can you find similarities between the tails? 3. Discuss possible similarities between the different types of tails with your group and write your answers in your exercise books. Use some different words to describe some of the tails. 4. Tails do different jobs for animals. What does the whale in the picture use its tail for? Did you know? When we talk about animals or plants, we use words like “most animals” or “many plants” because there are always plants or animals that are not like the others. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 352018/05/17 8:51:11 AM Life and living36 5. Both the chameleon and the squirrel have tails and live mostly in trees and bushes. But their movements are very different. A chameleon moves slowly, while a squirrel jumps from branch to branch and climbs up and down tree trunks. What does each of these animals use their tails for? 6. The male peacock has a very brightly coloured tail. Why do you think this is so? Let’s look at some more functions (uses) of tails. Tails help animals to do different things: • Move and swing in trees – monkeys for example. • Balance – for example, kangaroos use their tails to balance while they jump. • Kill their prey – crocodiles use their tails to spin them around when they need to drown their prey; scorpions often have poison in their tails. • Pat down the earth – beavers use their powerful tails to pat the ground down hard and solid. • Swim – almost all fish use their tails to swim. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 362018/05/17 8:51:11 AM 37Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals37 • Steer their movement – fish, whales, dolphin, sharks and many others use their tails as rudders to steer their direction. Bird tails are very important rudders in flight too. • Attract a mate – a peacock is a perfect example! • Keep warm – a squirrel or fox wraps its tail around it like a blanket to keep warm. • Get rid of flies – a cow or horse can swish their tail to get rid of flies. • Warn others of possible dangers – some deer flash the white underside of their tails to other deer to warn them of possible danger. • Communicate – dogs show their emotion in their tails. If they are happy to see you they wag their tails. • Protect – an armadillo has an armoured tail to protect itself. • Distract predators – if a lizard is attacked it will drop its tail and get away while the predator goes after the wriggling tail. As you probably realised animals’ tails are very important to them! Body Different animals need to cover their bodies in different ways. QUESTIONS Can you think of at least five different kinds of body coverings that animals have? Write them down it in your exercise books. Just like animals, people use specific body coverings for special reasons. Let’s think about reasons why people cover their bodies then we’ll see how this compares to animals. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 372018/05/17 8:51:11 AM Life and living38 ACTIVITY 2.6: Why do we cover our bodies? INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Think of where or when someone will wear these types of clothes. 2. Copy the table in your exercise books and write your answers in. ClothingWhere or when would people wear it? a. Thick jacket, scarf and gloves b. Bright thin dress with thin straps over the shoulders c. A black suit with black pants and bow tie d. Grey skirt and white short sleeve blouse, black shoes and white socks e. A costume People wear different kinds of clothes in different environments. If they are cold people will wear warm clothes, and if they are hot most people will wear much fewer and thinner clothes. Animals also have different body coverings, which most cannot change when the weather changes. QUESTIONS Why do you think a bird is covered in feathers and not scales? Why does a whale have smooth thick skin but an octopus has slimy slippery skin? Why is it that a cat has a soft furry skin but a crocodile’s body is covered in hard bone-like scales? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 382018/05/17 8:51:11 AM 39Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals39 Animals need to cover their bodies in special ways for a few reasons: 1. Body coverings need to protect the animals’ organs, bones and muscles from their environment, UV rays, bumps and scratches, and from germs and bacteria that might cause infection. A warm furry body protects a polo bear in the arctic just like a scaly body protects the armadillo and crocodile. 2. They need to blend into their environment to hide from predators. Lions hide themselves in the veld grass to stop their prey from seeing them. 3. Males often use their body covering to attract female attention. A peacock has his beautiful tail feathers and a lion has his mane. ACTIVITY 2.7: Compare animal body coverings INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Carefully look at (examine) the body covering of each animal in the photos below. 2. Then think about where the animal lives. 3. Copy the table in your exercise books and answer these questions: • What does each animal’s body covering do for it? • Where does this animal live? AnimalBody coveringWhere does it live? Snail 5 1.

Some animals like chimpanzees and squirrels can use their front or upper limbs to handle objects. 6. 7. 8. 9. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 412018/05/17 8:51:12 AM Life and living42 Look at the pictures of the different animals in the previous activity. How many different limbs can you see on these animals? Animals can have wings, webbed feet, tentacles, fins, legs, arms, flippers and long slithery bodies with no limbs, such as the earthworm. Sense organs Animals can sense much more than humans can. Dogs, for example, can sense things and help humans with this. Sniffer dogs help to find people who are trapped under building rubble, mudslides or snow and tell the rescue workers where the victims are. These dogs also smell drugs or bombs and alert the police. Sniffer dogs at the airport. 10 • Eagles, buzzards, hawks and other birds of prey have extremely sharp eyes as they have to see a small rodents from very far away. • Elephants, cats and dogs can hear sounds that human ears cannot hear. • Bats, dolphins and some whales use a special sense called eco-location. They send out special sound waves and can find prey or objects from quite far away. • Butterflies, bees and earthworms have another special sense called chemoreceptors – they taste through their skin or feet. Did you know? Blowflies have 3 000 hairs in their feet that they use to taste with! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 422018/05/17 8:51:12 AM 43Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals43 • Animals like ants, cockroaches or crayfish have special sense receptors that can sense something moving from very far away! Cats have very good hearing QUESTIONS Think back to the seven life processes and why we can say that an animal is alive. Look at the basic structure of an animal, at their head, limbs, body, tail and sense organs. How does the basic structure of animals help them carry out the seven life processes? ACTIVITY 2.8: Label drawings of animals When you were learning about plants, you also learnt how to label scientific drawings. In this activity you are going to practise your labelling skills. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Study each of the drawings of different animals on page 44. 2. Use your scientific labelling skills to label each animal with the five body structures of animals. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 432018/05/17 8:51:12 AM Life and living44 Animals all look very different. Some have long legs and others have short stubby claws, some have big eyes and others have thousands of tiny eyes together in one big eye. They come in all shapes and sizes! QUESTIONS Have a look at pages 2 and 3 that introduces Life and Living at the beginning of the term. You can see the Quantum Club exploring the jungle. Can you see all the different shapes and sizes of the animals? How many different animals can you spot? ACTIVITY 2.9: Small, medium, large or extra large? Do you sometimes go shopping with your family? Have you seen that shops use the words small, medium, large and extra large when they compare things like pizzas, eggs or clothes? Sometimes people just use S, M, L and XL to show the size. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 442018/05/17 8:51:12 AM 45Chapter 2: Structure of plants and animals45 INSTRUCTIONS: 1.

NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 482018/05/17 8:51:13 AM 49 3 What plants need to grow KEY QUESTIONS • How can I grow my own plants? • If I plant seeds, what must I do to make sure that they grow? • What does a plant actually need to stay alive and grow? 3.1 Conditions for growth What do plants need to grow? Do you remember learning about living and non-living things? We said that almost all things on earth are either living or non-living. The plants and animals that are living need to carry out the seven life processes. Do you remember what they are? Plants make all the food that all the animals on Earth need to stay alive. If all the plants were to suddenly vanish, life on Earth would be not be possible. We need to take care of the plants on our planet. In this section we are going to learn about what makes plants grow and keeps them alive. We will also look at growing new plants. How can you make sure that as many of your seeds as possible sprout and grow into healthy plants? QUESTIONS In Activity 1.4 on page 15 you planted a bean seed. How did your bean grow? Did it die or did it stay alive? Discuss what you think your bean plant will need to stay alive and continue growing. New words • sprout • adapt • dissolve • fertile • cuttings • shoots NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 492018/05/17 8:51:13 AM Life and living50 What do plants need to grow? I am excited to find out and to grow my own plant! Sunlight • Plants need sunlight to grow and live. • Green plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide gas to make food. • The plant can use some of this food to grow and develop. • It stores the rest of the food for animals to eat. • When animals and humans eat plants they get energy from the plant. SunLeafCaterpillar The plant leaf uses sunlight energy to make food and grow. The caterpillar eats the leaf. Air Just like animals and people, plants also need air to live and grow. Plants use carbon dioxide to make food so that they can grow. Water Plants need water to grow and to make food. Some plants need more water than others. The amount of water a plant needs depends on the type of plant. If the plant does not get the amount of water it needs it will die. Some plants are able to grow in very dry areas, such as cacti in the desert. These plants have adapted (changed) over many, many years to be able to survive in these conditions. Visit What plants need to grow (video). goo.gl/dzDGr Did you know? The picture of the sun, leaf and caterpillar is an example of a food chain. You will learn more about food chains in Grade 5. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 502018/05/17 8:51:13 AM 51Chapter 3: What plants need to grow51 In the photo below the raindrops are collecting on the leaves. They will then roll down and soak into the soil. The roots of the plant absorb water from the soil. This water carries nutrients from the soil to all the parts of the plant. Raindrops collecting on leaves. 1 Remember, a plant needs water, sunlight and carbon dioxide to make food. Soil Most plants grow well if they are planted in fertile soil: • Plants are anchored in the soil by their roots. • Their roots absorb the dissolved nutrients from the soil. • To make sure plants get enough of these mineral nutrients we often add some fertiliser or compost to the soil. We say that soil that has a lot of nutrients is rich or fertile. New plants growing in the soil. 2 NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 512018/05/17 8:51:14 AM Life and living52 3.2 Growing new plants Plants can generally be grown from seeds or cuttings. • Seeds grow from flowers and are fertilised with pollen from another flower. Fertilised seeds can then germinate to start growing into a new plant. • A cutting is made when a piece of a plant (usually the stem) is cut off and planted in new soil to start growing roots and form a new plant. • Plants can also grow from shoots, which are little roots that shoot out of special places in the stem of some plants. QUESTIONS What three really important things do plants need to grow? Do you remember that one of the life processes is reproduction? How do plants make new plants? What seeds need to germinate You have learnt that seeds are important to grow new plants. A plant needs to germinate from the seed to start growing. This means that the seed has to develop into a new plant and grow all the necessary plant parts. In Activity 1.4, we germinated a bean seed and saw that although it seemed to be non-living, it can be revived from its dormant state. Have you ever wondered what seeds need to germinate and grow into new plants? Let’s find out by doing a Science investigation! New words • aim • prediction • apparatus • results • observations • control group • conclusion • data • experiment • legend NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 522018/05/17 8:51:14 AM 53Chapter 3: What plants need to grow53 INVESTIGATION 3.1: What does a seed need to germinate? You will be working in groups to investigate different questions. The aim (purpose) and prediction will depend on the question you want to answer in your investigation. AIM: An aim in a science investigation is where we state what the purpose of the investigation is. What do you want to find out by doing this investigation? PREDICTION: A prediction is when you predict (make a guess) what the result of your investigation will be. But it is not just any guess. You must think about what you think will happen in your investigation. What do you think will happen to your seed and how will it change? APPARATUS: Apparatus is the scientific name for the equipment you will need: • Bean seeds for each group • Shallow containers for each group (saucers, jar lids or yoghurt tubs) • Cotton wool (or strips of newspaper) • Dark cupboard or box • Fridge (perhaps there is one in the staffroom) • Ruler METHOD: The method is the steps of what you must do. Each group will have a slightly different method, depending on what you are investigating. Follow the instructions for your group. Group A – Control Important! A control is where the bean seed is given everything that we think it needs to germinate. In the other investigations, one of these things will be left out. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 532018/05/17 8:51:14 AM Life and living54 1. Wrap your bean in cotton wool or newspaper. 2. Place it in the shallow container (saucer or lid). 3. Wet the cotton wool and be careful not to flood it! 4. Place the container with the wet cotton wool and bean in a sunny spot. 5. Water your cotton wool daily and make sure that it stays damp. 6. Regularly check your bean’s progress. 7. Keep a diary during the next few weeks to write down what you see happening. This is called recording your observations. 8. Once the seeds germinate, measure the length of the stems each day and record your results. Your teacher will show you how to do this. Group B – No water 1. Wrap your bean in cotton wool or newspaper. 2. Place it in the shallow container (saucer or lid). 3. Do not wet the cotton wool! You want to see if a plant needs water to germinate so you must not give it water. 4. Place the container with the cotton wool and bean in a sunny spot. 5. Regularly check your bean’s progress. 6. Keep a diary during the next few weeks to write down what you see happening. This is called recording your observations. Group C – No warmth 1. Wrap your bean in cotton wool or newspaper. 2. Place it in the shallow container (saucer or lid). 3. Wet the cotton wool and be careful not to flood it! 4. Place the container with the wet cotton wool and bean in the fridge. 5. Water your cotton wool daily and make sure that it stays damp. 6. Regularly check your bean’s progress. 7. Keep a diary during the next few weeks to write down what you see happening. This is called recording your observations. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 542018/05/17 8:51:14 AM 55Chapter 3: What plants need to grow55 RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS (What you observed and found out): 1. Copy the table below in your exercise books and record the results or data from each groups’ observations. ControlNo waterNo warmth Was there a change on Day 1? Did the seeds germinate? When did the seeds first germinate? Did the new plants grow once they had germinated? 2. Now let’s focus on the data (results) we collected from the Control Group so we can see how the plants grew over time: a. When the first beans germinate, make a drawing of a bean that germinated and the first root that appeared. b. When the first plants start to grow further and produce leaves, make a drawing of a bean, the root and its first leaf. 3. Use your exercise books to draw a table where you record the data you collected from the Control Group and the length of the stems each day after they germinated. A table is very useful in Science investigations to record and present a lot of data. A table must also have a heading. 4. We are now going to draw a graph. Graphs are another way of presenting (showing) our results. They are often used by scientists to show their results. Drawing graphs is a very important skill! We will use the results from the table above to draw a graph. There are many different types of graphs, but we will draw a line graph. If this is the first time you are drawing a graph, do not worry! Your teacher will help you. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 552018/05/17 8:51:14 AM Life and living56 CONCLUSION (What we have learnt): When we do a science investigation, we always have to write a conclusion at the end. This summarises what we have learnt from the results of our experiment. For this Science investigation, write a conclusion where you state what you have learnt. KEY CONCEPTS • Plants need light, water and air to grow. • You can grow new plants from cuttings or seeds. • A cutting is a stem, leaf or part of a plant that can be used to grow a new plant. • Germination is when seeds revive from their dormant state and start to grow. • Seeds need water, warmth and air to germinate and grow. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 562018/05/17 8:51:14 AM 57Chapter 3: What plants need to grow57 REVISION 1. Explain what germination means. 2. What does a seed need to germinate? 3. What does a plant need to grow? 4. Two of the same plants were grown in different places. One plant got a lot of rain and was planted where there was sunshine. The other plant also got a lot of rain, but hardly any sunshine. After two weeks the following measurements were taken: PlantLength of plant Plant 115 cm Plant 24 cm Which plant do you think grew in the shadowy place? Why do you say so? 5. Complete the bar graph: a. Copy the bar graph below. b. Choose a different colour for each plant and colour in the bar for it. c. Also colour in the little boxes on the side that tell you which plant is which. This is called a legend.

Animals tend to live naturally in specific areas. Different kinds of plants grow naturally in certain areas too. Plants and animals will choose where they live mostly because of the water, food and climate of a specific area. The place that a plant or animal lives in is called a habitat. The physical environment also plays a part in an organism’s choice of habitat (home). For example, plants prefer certain types of soil to grow in. You can easily see if a plant does not like to grow in a specific area/habitat. It will stay small and have few leaves. If a plant is in an area that it likes it will grow big and strong and have lots of leaves. A pond is a natural habitat to many different animals, such as fish, birds, snakes, frogs and other small mammals. New words • habitat • organism NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 582018/05/17 8:51:14 AM 59Chapter 4: Habitats of animals and plants59 A habitat is the physical area where the animal or plant lives. An organism’s natural habitat has everything it needs to live. QUESTIONS Look at pages 2 and 3 where you can see the Quantum Club exploring a habitat! What type of habitat do you think this is? Name some of the plants and animals that live in this habitat. 4.2 Different habitats There are many kinds of habitats that plants and animals like to live in. Some areas of the Karoo in South Africa are semi-desert areas where plants are adapted to grow in dry, hot habitats. 1 • Some plants and animals choose to live in the hot, dry desert. These plants and animals do not need as much water as other types. • Some animals and plants live in a forest or cave habitat because they prefer cooler, shady areas. • In South Africa there are many forest habitats. There used to be many wild elephants that lived in the Knysna forest in the in the Western Cape. But today there are hardly any left as many were killed by humans. New words • desert • forest • grassland • wetland • indigenous NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 592018/05/17 8:51:14 AM Life and living60 Their forest habitat has also become smaller because humans moved in and cut down the trees. So the number of elephants have decreased. The plants growing on the forest floor like a shady, cooler habitat. 2 • Other plants and animals choose to live along the shoreline where the water meets the land. This is because they prefer a wet environment, but they are also able to live on land. Animals that live along the shoreline need to have strong bodies to protect them against waves and seagulls. This is why many may have shells to cover their bodies. QUESTIONS Identify three animals that live at the shoreline and have shells or hard armour covering their bodies. If you have not been to the shoreline, choose another habitat close to your home and identify three animals from that habitat. A rocky shoreline habitat in the Knysna lagoon. 3 Did you know? When animals and plants are known to be found in a specific habitat, we say they are indigenous to the area. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 602018/05/17 8:51:15 AM 61Chapter 4: Habitats of animals and plants61 • Water plants like to grow in or very near to rivers, lagoons or wetlands. Some animals always live in the water, while others are only in the water sometimes. QUESTIONS Write down the names of two animals that are always in water and two that are only sometimes in water. • There are even animals and plants that live in the very cold regions near the arctic poles or in very high mountains. Marion island is an island towards the South Pole and near South Africa. Scientists study animals that live on the island to learn more about them and how they adapt to their habitats. ACTIVITY 4.1: Discovering habitats In this activity you are going to find a habitat in your school, then draw and describe the habitat. MATERIALS: • Scrap paper and pencils • Clipboard or something hard to press on when you draw • Paper for final drawings • Coloured pencils or crayons INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in groups to find a habitat in your school where different plants and animals live. 2. Carefully look at your habitat without moving or changing anything in your habitat. Can you see any animals in your habitat? 3. Ask one person to turn over large rocks one at a time so you can see what is under the rock. Many insects and spiders live under the rocks. Also look under the bushes or shrubs for animals that might be hiding from you! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 612018/05/17 8:51:15 AM Life and living62 4. Make a drawing of the habitat you observe on scrap paper. This is your rough drawing. You will redraw your habitat when you get back to class. Add in only the plants and little animals that you can see in your habitat. 5. Carefully study the colours of the different plants in your habitat. 6. Once your whole group has finished their drawings, return to your class. 7. Redraw your habitat in class on new clean paper. Use colour pencils or other colouring in materials to add colour and detail to your drawing. 8. Give your drawing a heading and add labels to name the different plants and animals that you recognised. Display your drawings in the class. QUESTIONS: 1. Explain where the habitat was that your group studied. 2. What kind of habitat did you study? Use some words to describe the habitat, such as shady, sandy and wet. 3. Name the different animals that you could see in your habitat. 4. Were there any plants that you recognised in the habitat? Name these plants. 5. If it started raining very heavily, how would the plants and animals in your habitat be affected? 6. How do you think your plants and animals are affected in winter? Will they be able to survive the cold conditions? Explain why you say so. 7. Is there any damage from people in your habitat? If so, how do you think you could prevent this damage? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 622018/05/17 8:51:15 AM 63Chapter 4: Habitats of animals and plants63 4.3 Why do animals need a habitat? Animals and plants need food, water and shelter in their habitat. Animals also need a safe place to have their young (babies) and to hide from predators and escape from other danger. Let’s look at some more of the reasons why animals need a habitat. Camouflage in a habitat Some animals rely on their habitat to escape danger or to hide from the food they are trying to catch! To help them do this they blend in with their surroundings. This is called camouflage. Animals use camouflage for two reasons: 1. Some use it to hide from predators. In other words, their camouflage helps protect them from other animals that eat them. 2. Others use it to hide from their prey. When they are hunting it helps them sneak up on other animals without being seen. Animals are camouflaged in different ways. Let’s look at some animals and the way they use their habitats to escape danger! A chameleon can change its The endangered western skin colour to blend in with its leopard toad uses its spots surroundings. 4 to blend into its surroundings and hide from predators. 5 New words • camouflage • national symbol NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 632018/05/17 8:51:15 AM Life and living64 ACTIVITY 4.2: Finding hidden animals! INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Some animals are really good at blending into their habitats. Look at the photos below of different animals and their camouflage. 2. Identify the animal in the photos. 3. How does each animal use its camouflage to blend into its surroundings? Write the answers in your exercise books.

That was fun! My pink ribbon is not very camouflaged, is it? Habitats of indigenous animals in South Africa South Africa is very well-known for its Big Five, as the lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino are known. Many tourists visit our country to see these animals. But how do they know where to find these African wild animals? Let’s help them! ACTIVITY 4.3: Understanding the habitats of indigenous South African animals MATERIALS: • A piece of A2 cardboard and A4 paper. • Information about the Big Five. • Pictures of the Big Five from old magazines, newspaper cuttings or photocopied images. • Coloured pens and pencils. • Scissors. • Glue. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. You are going to make a poster for tourists about the Big Five and where to find each animal. 2. Work in groups of five and assign one of the Big Five to each group member. Each person in your group will investigate one of the Big Five animals. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 652018/05/17 8:51:16 AM Life and living66 3. Each group member must bring information from home (or from the library) about their animal. This must include what the animal eats, where it lives, and how it reproduces. 4. Bring all your information and pictures to class. If you do not have any pictures, then use your pencils and crayons to draw some pictures of the Big Five. 5. In your group, plan the poster you are going to make about where to find each of the animals on the A4 paper. 6. Once you have finished your plan, use the bigger sheet of paper to make your real poster. (Remember to give your poster a heading.) 7. Present your poster to the class. My favourite Big Five animal is the elephant. I love drawing the texture of their wrinkly skin! QUESTIONS What would you tell a tourist about where to find the Big Five animals in their natural habitat? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 662018/05/17 8:51:16 AM 67Chapter 4: Habitats of animals and plants67 National symbols of South Africa South Africa has five animals and plants as our national symbols. National symbols are used to identify a country. National symbols are animals and plants that live in habitats found in our country and seas: • National bird – blue crane • National animal – springbok • National fish – galjoen Blue crane in a river Springbok grazing QUESTIONS Can you see the differences between the habitats of the Blue Crane and the Springbok? Write down some of the differences in your exercise books. • National flower – king protea • National tree – Real yellowwood Protea 6 NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 672018/05/17 8:51:16 AM Life and living68 ACTIVITY 4.4: Research project on South Africa’s national symbols MATERIALS: • Books and reading material about South Africa’s national animals and plants • Scrap paper for making notes • Pencils for colouring and writing • Cardboard to make a poster (for example from cereal boxes) INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs to find out as much as you can by reading in books or asking a family member about the plants and animals that are South Africa’s national symbols. 2. Choose two of the animals and two of the plants. 3. Explain why they were chosen as national symbols. 4. Describe each one’s habitat. 5. Explain why these animals and plants can survive in their habitats – how specifically are they suited to live there? 6. Identify ways that we can protect and look after these animals and plants. 7. Present your research as a poster. KEY CONCEPTS • Habitat is the place where a plant or animal mostly lives. • There are different kinds of habitats, such as grassland, forest, river, sea and desert. • Animals need a habitat for food, water, shelter, to reproduce, and also to escape from danger.

I do not think I could even do it! • What different kinds of animal structures do you get? • How do I build an animal shelter? 5.1 Natural and human-made shelters Natural shelters Remember earlier you dealt with living and non-living things. Living things need some shelter to protect them from harsh weather conditions. Some animals live in natural habitats for their homes. Other animals build their own homes. Some animals even live in other animal’s homes. A natural shelter is a home that the animal has made for itself. Animals live in different kinds of homes: • holes in the ground • caves • nests • trees Animals live in all sorts of places! Let’s find out! New words • natural materials • hive • hexagon • colony • burrow • network • human-made NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 702018/05/17 8:51:17 AM 71Chapter 5: Structures for animal shelters71 Look at the pictures of a few places where animals live. Let’s take a look at a few shelters that animals build and the materials they use. Nests Nests are built by birds and other animals in trees, on the ground and even in buildings. This is used as a home for them and especially for their eggs. Nests are usually bowl-shaped and made of twigs, leaves and grass held together by mud or saliva (spit). Swallows build their nests from mud on the underside of roofs where they are protected from the rain. In caves On land UndergroundIn trees In water Did you know? Some people believe it is good luck if a swallow builds its nest at your home or school! The swallows will return year after year to their nest. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 712018/05/17 8:51:17 AM Life and living72 Colonies Bees live in very large colonies. The hive is made up of many six-sided cells (hexagons) stuck together. The queen bee lays all the eggs in a hive and each egg is put in a cell. A natural bee hive in a tree. 1 Meerkats burrow and dig huge networks of tunnels underground. 2 Burrows Small rodents such as squirrels, rabbits, mice and moles dig burrows in the ground, or under logs and rocks, to provide them with shelter. These burrows often form an underground network of tunnels in which these animals live. Ants and earthworms also live in the ground. Webs Spiders spin webs from silk that they make in their bodies. The web isn’t only a home for the spider, it also helps the spider to catch its prey. Did you know? Ants build shelters to save their colonies from drowning. When water floods their nests they hold onto each other and can float like that for many weeks at a time. A spider web between the twigs of a plant. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 722018/05/17 8:51:17 AM 73Chapter 5: Structures for animal shelters73 Human-made shelters Other animals live in shelters that were built by humans. These shelters are normally for our pets or the animals that we farm. QUESTIONS Below are the names of three types of animals that we keep as pets or farm. We have to build shelters for them. In your exercise books, write down the name of the shelter next to each animal’s name and describe it briefly. • Dogs • Bees • Pigs ACTIVITY 5.1: Describing human-made animal shelters INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the photos of human-made animal shelters. 2. Copy the table in your exercise books and complete it by filling in the answers. 1 3 2 4 3 5 Animal that will live in this shelter Materials that the shelter is made of Why will it be a good shelter for this animal? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 732018/05/17 8:51:18 AM Life and living74 5.2 Structures and materials for animal shelters Structures are built by joining different parts together. Different materials are used to make structures. These structures come in different sizes and shapes. Structures have four types of functions (jobs), they primarily serve to: • protect • contain • support • span a gap Each of the structures shown in the photos below do one or more of the jobs or functions of structures. They are made from different materials. Carefully look at the different shapes that are used in the structures.

ACTIVITY 5.2: Looking at structures INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs and look at the photos of structures on page 74. 2. Discuss each photograph with your partner. 3. Look at the shape and size of the structure, and the materials used to construct it. Use the S, M, L and XL to describe the size as you did in Activity 2.8 on page 44 for animals. 4. Record your findings in the table provided: Size of the structure Shapes used in the structure Materials used in the structure Egg in a shell Bridge Water tower Bird cage Let’s learn more about different kinds of structures. Shell and frame structures Shell structures mainly contain and/or protect the contents. A bird’s egg protects the little chick growing inside it. A car gives some protection to its passengers. A pot holds the food inside it. A frame structure gives support. There is a frame structure inside your body – your skeleton supports your body! Your knees and elbows are places where the bones join. A frame structure must carry a load in the right places without it collapsing or falling over. Visit Strength of an egg shell (video). goo.gl/ZLl1d NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 752018/05/17 8:51:18 AM Life and living76 Frames are made of members and joins. The members are the long parts and the joins are where the long parts come together. Sometimes longer tubes can be joined to make triangles. The tubes are called the members. Where the tubes come together that is called the join. QUESTIONS 1. List three types of structures. 2. What is the difference between shell and frame structures? 3. What kinds of functions do shell and frame structures serve? a. Functions of shell structures: b. Functions of frame structures: The Technology Process When we design and make products and structures we use a special way to do this, called the technology process. The technology process helps you to design and make products. The technology process has five steps: 1. Investigate 2. Design 3. Make 4. Evaluate 5. Communicate We use the technology process to investigate a specific problem. We then use this information to design and make something to help us solve the problem. While we work on the design and make the product, we constantly evaluate it to see if it is working. Does it do what we meant for it to do? We can also talk to our friends working with us about what we plan to do. We explain how we want to design or make the product. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 762018/05/17 8:51:18 AM 77Chapter 5: Structures for animal shelters77 Many people use the technology process every day. If you want to design and make something to solve a problem, you can also use it. Whenever we do a technology project in Natural Sciences and Technology, we will be following these steps. Designing an animal shelter Let’s use the technology process to help some birds in your area. Remember you need to start by first identifying the problem. Then you can start to design and make a shelter to solve the problem (solution). This sounds like fun! I am excited to use the technology process to design and make something. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 772018/05/17 8:51:19 AM Life and living78 ACTIVITY 5.3: Design and make a shelter for wild birds HELP! THE BIRDS NEED YOU! Many of the trees in your town have been chopped down to make space for homes and other buildings. The birds that made nests in the trees now have nowhere to safely lay their eggs. There are many more rats, mice and other pests in the city because there are fewer birds to catch them. This is because many birds left to find safe places to build their nests and raise their chicks. Some of the birds that stayed behind tried to make nests on rooftops but the people did not like the mess they made and destroyed the nests. Other birds tried to build their nests on tall radio and television towers. But then the people could not get their televisions or radios to work properly so they also broke their nests and scared the birds away. The people are complaining about all the pests that are in the city and the birds want to come back but do not have a safe place to build nests. They need your help! In the previous section we learnt about animal shelters. We need to help these birds by making shelters or places for them to roost. We also have to make them look good for the people. DESIGN BRIEF: A design brief is a short description of what you plan to do. An example of a design brief for this project could be: “Design and make an animal shelter that can be used by wild birds.” INVESTIGATE: The next step in the technology process is to investigate and do some research on the shelter that you are going to make. We have actually already done this in Activity 5.2 when we looked at different human-made animal shelters. So let’s get on to designing! DESIGN: We now need to design the animal shelter. In your groups, discuss the following questions. They will help guide your NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 782018/05/17 8:51:19 AM 79Chapter 5: Structures for animal shelters79 design and make you think about what your bird shelter should look like. 1. What is the purpose of the bird shelter? 2. What shape and size will the shelter be? 3. How will the birds get inside? 4. What are the best materials to make the shelter from? 5. Will there be a place to provide the birds with food and water? When we design something there are some things that the product or structure you are making needs to do, or some things that it cannot do. We call these specifications (what it must do) and constraints (what it cannot do). We need to show the specifications or things that your product must do or have before we start to design or make it. You have to make a list of all the specifications otherwise you might not make your product in the proper way. When we list specifications and constraints, we answer certain questions. You answered some of these questions above. Specifications 1. Purpose of the bird shelter 2. Size of the bird shelter 3. Materials used to make the bird shelter Constraints Some constraints for your bird shelter could be: 1. The materials used must be able to withstand the weather outside, such as wind and rain. 2. A constraint could even be that you have to design and make it in class. Drawing the design for the bird shelter In this step you draw what you want your bird shelter to look like. You might need to make many drawings until you decide which design you want to use. It is a good idea to use scrap paper for this. Label the different parts of your design and say what material each part is made of. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 792018/05/17 8:51:19 AM Life and living80 EVALUATE: Once you have a design drawing that you are happy with, you would then make the shelter. We are not going to do this now. Later in the year you will get a chance to make some of the designs. For now, let’s evaluate the design that you did. This means you must decide whether your product will be able to solve the problem you identified at the beginning. To do this you go back to the problem and ask the following questions: 1. Has my design solved the problem and how? 2. Did I stick to the specifications and constraints? (Ask this question of all your specifications separately.) 3. If you changed some of the specifications, such as the size or materials, why did you do so? 4. Is there any way to improve your design? That was fun! I am going to try make my bird shelter at home and put it up outside our house. KEY CONCEPTS • Natural structures are made by animals, like nests and shells. • Human-made structures are made by people. • There are different kinds of structures, like frame and shell structures. • Structures can have different shapes and sizes. • Structures can be made from different materials. • Humans can make shelters for animals, especially pets and birds.

Everything around us is made up of matter. All solids, liquids and gases in the universe are matter. Matter takes up space and has mass, this means we can weigh matter. When we use one kind of matter to make something, such as a wooden or plastic chair, we say the material used was wood or plastic. 6.1 Solids, liquids and gases Materials are all around us. Some materials are solids, some are liquids and some are gases. A material will always be one of these three things. But what exactly are solids, liquids and gases? Let’s investigate the material properties of solids, liquids and gases. When is a material a solid? The word “property” has different meanings. We say this house is the property of Mr Mabusa, he is the owner of the house. When we use the word “property” in Science New words • matter • mass • solid • liquid • gas • properties • common properties • diffuse • states of matter • substances NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 842018/05/17 8:51:21 AM 85Chapter 6: Materials around us85 we look at what makes that kind of material special. How does it behave differently from other kinds of materials? For example when you shift a chair to another place, it will still have the same shape. This is because the chair is solid. So we can say that all solids keep their shape. We say that keeping its shape is a property of a solid. Let’s look at some of the properties of solids. A chair is made of solid materials. 1 ACTIVITY 6.1: Exploring the properties of solids MATERIALS: • A stone • Cloth • Paper • A table or chair • A pen or any solids around you INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs and copy the table on page 86 in your exercise books. Use the questions below to investigate each solid: • Does it feel hard or soft? • Does it make a sound when you knock on it? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 852018/05/17 8:51:21 AM Matter and materials86 • Does it break easily? Can it break? • Can you put your finger through it? • Is your hand dry or wet after handling the object? • Does it change its shape when you put it in something else? • How will you describe the shape. Is it fixed, does it remain the same? 2. Fill in your answers about each of the objects on the table. 3. There are some empty rows at the bottom for you to fill in any other solid objects that you might have investigated. ObjectYour observations Stone Cloth Paper A table or chair Pen QUESTIONS: 1. Which properties were the same (common) for all the solids you investigated? 2. List some other solid objects in your classroom. Give at least four examples. We have learned that a material in a solid form will have a fixed shape and take up a definite space. Let’s now look at liquids. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 862018/05/17 8:51:21 AM 87Chapter 6: Materials around us87 What is a liquid? There are liquids all around and you use them in your everyday lives. Some examples are water, paraffin, baby oil, fruit juice, petrol and methylated spirits. What are the common properties of liquids? When scientists want to know more about something they ask questions. Then they try to answer the questions by doing experiments. ACTIVITY 6.2: Exploring the properties of liquids MATERIALS: • Water • Paraffin • Baby oil • Fruit juice • Methylated spirits • Five small pieces of cloth • Containers for each of the liquids • Five other clean and empty containers (glass, cooldrink bottle or tin) • Five saucers or lids INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in groups. Each group must test a different liquid. 2. Select someone in your group to collect a liquid in a container from the teacher. Each group must also collect another empty container and a saucer from your teacher. 3. Copy the table on page 88 in your exercise books. Give your table a heading. Important! Do not taste the liquid! • How does it smell? • Can you put your finger through it? • Is your hand dry or wet feeling the liquid? • Can you soak the liquid up with a cloth? 4. Answer these questions while you are studying your liquid. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 872018/05/17 8:51:21 AM Matter and materials88 5. Put a small amount of the liquid in the saucer and leave it for a while in a warm place. • Was it easy to pour the liquid from one container to another? • Can the liquid flow or spread out on a saucer? • How will you describe the shape of the liquid, is it fixed or does it take the shape of the container? • Did the amount of the liquid stay the same after leaving it in a warm place? Important! Wash your hands after handling the liquid. ObservationsAnswer What did your liquid smell like? Was your hand dry or wet after touching the liquid? Did the shape of the liquid change when you poured it into another container? What happened to the liquid when you left it in a warm place? QUESTIONS: 1. Write down the safety rules for this investigation. Why are these safety rules taken? 2. Write down those properties that were the same (common) for all the liquids investigated. After doing this activity where we investigated the properties of liquids, we can say that a liquid: • can flow • has no fixed shape • takes the shape of the container that it is in. This is different to a solid. Remember a solid has a fixed shape and you cannot pour a solid. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 882018/05/17 8:51:21 AM 89Chapter 6: Materials around us89 What is a gas? Do you remember in the first term when we spoke about breathing as one of the seven life processes of living things? When we breathe, we are taking in and giving out gases. But we cannot see the gases! Gases are a bit more difficult to understand as we usually cannot see gases. We can see places where gases are used and the containers that they are kept in. Do you know any gases? What about the gas used in a stove to cook food? Have you seen the gas coming out of the exhaust of a car? In hospitals there are cylinders filled with oxygen gas for patients with breathing problems. The air you breathe in has oxygen gas. The air you breathe out has more carbon dioxide gas. Look at the following pictures of where a gas is being used. Visit Video on gases. goo.gl/sf9TG Cooking using a gas stove. A patient in hospital with an oxygen The gas is in a cylinder and mask on.

These were solid, liquids and gases. A substance can change from one state to another. For example, a solid can change into a liquid. Water can be a liquid in your glass or in the freezer water is ice. Ice is a solid. But what makes these substances change from one state to another? What causes a change of state? We know that matter can be in the solid, liquid or gas state. Let’s use water as an example. QUESTIONS If you pour tap water into an ice tray and put it in the freezer, what will happen to the water? What happens to the ice cubes if you put them in the sun? The difference between the freezer and the sun outside is that one is hot and the other is cold. So if we place the water in a place that is cold enough, it freezes. If we place the ice cubes in a hot place, they melt. This is because the state of matter can be changed from one to another by adding or removing heat. Let’s read a story to try understand this a bit more. New words • melting • solidify (freeze) • change of state • evaporating • condensing • water vapour • temperature • thermometer NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 932018/05/17 8:51:22 AM Matter and materials94 ACTIVITY 6.5: The story of Mashadu INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Read the story below about Mashadu. 2. Answer the questions that follow. Mashadu and the Quantum Club Mashadu is a boy in Grade 1 at a primary school in a small village, which gets very hot in summer. He loves to play soccer. After school he often goes over to The Quantum School of Learning to play with the Quantum Club. They really like having Mashadu over, even though he is a few years younger, because he is very talented, fun and caring. Mashadu especially likes Phumlani and they play well together as a team. One day after school, Mashadu thought he would do something nice for his friends, the Quantum Club and surprise them with ice lollies for when they were finished playing. Mashadu bought five ice lollies, one for himself and one for each of the Quantum Club. He put the ice lollies in a bowl and put some ice blocks around them to keep them cool. Mashadu then ran off to join the others playing soccer. After the game, Mashadu ran back to the bowl to get the ice lollies. But he got such a shock when he got there. They were all gone! He was so upset and started to cry. The Quantum Club saw that Mashadu was upset and ran over to see what was wrong. “Hey Mashadu, what’s wrong?! Did you hurt yourself while playing?” Phumlani asked. “No, I didn’t. I bought some ice lollies for all of you as a surprise and when I came back now to get them they were all gone! I think someone stole and ate them and just left the sticks! Look!” Mashadu cried out. “Oh no, don’t cry Mashadu! It’s not your fault, and no one stole them or ate them either,” Mothusi said, while rubbing Mashadu on the back. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 942018/05/17 8:51:22 AM 95Chapter 6: Materials around us95 “Yes, Mashadu, actually we learned in class today about what happened to your ice lollies,” said Felicity. “I can explain it to you too. Do you see that your bowl is actually not empty? There is a liquid in it. And it also has a red colour, which was the colour of your ice lollies.” “Yes, I see that,” answered Mashadu, “but then how did that happen?” Walt then answered, “Your ice lollies melted from the heat from the air around us. Even if the sun was not so hot, they would have melted! For something to stay frozen it needs to be at a very cold temperature, like in a freezer.” “Yes, melting is when heat causes the solid ice lollies to change into a liquid,” Felicity replied, “So no one stole the ice lollies, they just melted.” “Oh ok, I see,” said Mashadu, “I must be really silly not to know that!” “No not at all Mashadu! We only learned about it today in class and we are in Grade 4!” laughed Mothusi. “I know what we should do!” shouted Phumlani, “Let’s go to the tuckshop right now. I have some extra change and we can buy some more frozen ice lollies!” They all really liked this idea, especially Mashadu who was now laughing. So off they all went, the Quantum Club and Mashadu. They bought some more ice lollies and sat under the tree to eat them. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 952018/05/17 8:51:22 AM Matter and materials96 QUESTIONS: 1. What is the name of the main character in the story? 2. What grade is he in? 3. What grade are the Quantum Club in? 4. What game are they playing together after school? 5. When the ice lollies are frozen, are they a solid, liquid or a gas? 6. Explain in your own words what happened to the ice and the ice lollies while they were left in the sun. 7. What is the name given to this process? 8. Do you think you can reverse the process of melting? How would you do this? 9. What is your favourite type of ice cream or ice lolly? 10. If you wanted to do something nice for your friends, what would you do? Melting and solidifying So what have we learned from Mashadu’s experience with the ice lollies? The ice lollies were frozen and cold. When they were placed in the sun, they started to warm up. This heat caused a change of state. The ice changed to a liquid. This is called melting. When Mashadu and the Quantum Club went to get new ice lollies from the Tuckshop, these ice lollies were frozen, but they were made from a liquid. The liquid was poured into the shape of an ice lolly and then they were cooled until they froze. When a liquid changes to a solid, this is called solidifying. Now that we have read about changes of state, let’s do some activities to learn more. Icebergs floating in the ocean are made of water that has frozen because it is so cold. 5 NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 962018/05/17 8:51:22 AM 97Chapter 6: Materials around us97 ACTIVITY 6.6: Heating and cooling to cause a change of state MATERIALS: • Kettle • Liquid water • Glass or mirror • Gloves or towel INSTRUCTIONS: Important! This activity can be dangerous, so your teacher will demonstrate it for you. 1. Boil the water in the kettle. 2. Put a glass or mirror 30 cm above the boiling kettle. Important! Wear thick gloves or use a towel to avoid burning your skin! 3. Your teacher will then let you come up to see what is taking place. Make sure you have a look at the mirror. QUESTIONS: 1. What was the change of state when the water boiled and became steam? 2. You cannot actually see the steam. The steam is extremely hot and quickly cools and forms tiny droplets in the air. When the steam changes into tiny water droplets, what is this called? Evaporating and condensing Evaporation takes place when liquid is heated. It means the water changes from the liquid to the gas state. We hang wet clothes out to dry in the sun. They dry as the water evaporates. 6 NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 972018/05/17 8:51:23 AM The steam that comes out of the kettle is extremely hot and you cannot see it. The steam quickly cools and forms tiny droplets in the air. These tiny droplets are visible and form the “cloud” that you see. When these tiny droplets hit the mirror they cool more and form the bigger droplets, which you see forming on the mirror. We say the steam condensed to form water. The change of state is from the gas state to the liquid state. Condensation takes place when heat is removed. When you leave a glass filled with cold water on the table, small droplets form on the outside. This is because there is water vapour in the air which cools down when it is near the cold glass. The water vapour in the air around the glass condenses as it changes from a gas to a liquid and forms the tiny droplets you can see. Water droplets on the outside of a cold glass. We now know that substances react to temperature changes around them. But where do we use what we learned in everyday life? Let us look at how milk reacts to low temperature.

So the process can be reversed or turned around again by removing heat. Let’s revise what we have learned from the story of Mashadu and the activities. We have learned some new big words which may be quite confusing! Chocolate melting on a hot surface. 8 Here is a summary of the different changes of state: Change of stateHeating or cooling?

The ice cream probably melted very quickly, but the chocolate took longer. Some substances melt very easily, while others need to be heated a while. Each substance starts melting at a certain temperature. This is called its melting point of a substance. Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (°C) with an instrument called a thermometer.

The land forms a small part. Did you know that the amount of water on Earth now is about the same as when the dinosaurs lived on our planet? How is that possible? The answer is that invisible water vapour in the air cools and condenses to form drops of water. The reverse process takes place when water evaporates. When the water evaporates, it cannot be seen any more as it has become a gas called water vapour. This process of water always changing from a liquid to a gas and back again is an ongoing process. It is called the water cycle. This is why the amount of water on Earth stays the same. In a cycle, a set of events (things that happen) keep on repeating in the same order. The Earth as seen from space. 9 What is the water cycle? The water cycle shows how water changes from one state to another in a cycle. It takes place all over our whole world.

The Science word for rain is precipitation. • In other clouds that become really cold, the water vapour freezes and forms snow or hail. The snow falls down to the ground and melts. • Some runoff water that falls to the ground flows down into the rivers and to the seas. • And this water will evaporate again forming part of the water cycle. Freezing Melting Precipitation (rain) Run off Evaporation Evaporation The water cycle Look at the image again that shows the water cycle. Use the picture to explain the water cycle to your partner. Do you understand all the steps in the process? Let’s make a model to help explain the water cycle. Models are very important in Science as they help to show an important process in real life. A model is something we build to explain what happens in real life. Visit The water cycle (video) goo.gl/LY6rG Did you know? Clouds are not actually soft and fluffy!

In chapter 6, we looked at materials all around us and how they can be either a solid, a liquid or a gas. Now we are going to look more closely at solid materials. 7.1 Solid materials all around us Almost everything around us is made of materials. The shoes you wear, the pen you write with, the glass you drink out of, cellphones, a soccer ball, all your toys, the chair you sit on – they are all made of materials. ACTIVITY 7.1: Investigating materials objects are made of INSTRUCTIONS: Study the object and answer the questions that follow. New words • object NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1092018/05/17 8:51:25 AM Matter and materials110 QUESTIONS: 1. What is this object called and what is it used for? 2.

Can you suggest another type of material that can be used to make this object? Do you think this material will work better? Give a reason for your answer. 5. The object has a zip. What is the function of the zip? 6. What material is the zip made from? Do you think this is a good choice of material? Give a reason for your answer. In Activity 7.1 you learnt about making objects. • We use materials to make useful objects. • We choose materials for a specific purpose when we make the object. We are now going to see how some materials are used to make new objects. We are also going to look at why some materials are better to use for making certain objects. 7.2 Raw and manufactured materials Every day we use different products made from different materials. The chair you are sitting on is made of a material called wood or plastic. Wood is from a tree. Wood comes from a natural resource. It can be used as a raw material by humans to make furniture. What does raw and manufactured mean? Where have you heard the word “raw” before? Perhaps it was when someone was talking about your food and they said the meat or vegetables were still raw as they had not been cooked yet. When we talk about raw food, it means the food has not been processed by cooking. When we process something we do something to it to turn it into something else with different properties. New words • raw material • natural resource • manufactured material • ceramics • species • plantation • wood and plant fibre • pulp • recycle • industry NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1102018/05/17 8:51:25 AM 111Chapter 7: Solid materials111 We can also talk about raw materials. This is when the material is in its natural state. It has not been processed yet. We find raw materials in the environment around us, such as the trees in a forest, or coal and oil underground. But, when this raw material has been processed, meaning humans have changed it, then we call it a manufactured material. Examples of raw materials are wood and plant fibre. Once wood and fibre have been processed, humans make it into paper. Paper is a manufactured material. Wood is a raw material. 1 Paper is a manufactured material made from wood and plant fibre. QUESTIONS Sheep are farmed for their wool. Wool is a raw material, but it is processed to make a manufactured material. What things are made from wool? Raw materials in our environment are used to make other materials that are very useful. Let’s look at some. Examples of raw materials used to make other materials • Animal skin is a raw material that is processed into leather to make shoes, handbags and belts. • Animal wool is used to make clothes, such as jerseys and scarves NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1112018/05/17 8:51:25 AM Matter and materials112 • Sand is a natural, raw material. Sand is heated to extremely high temperatures and melted to make glass. • Clay is moulded and baked to make ceramics like teacups, teapots and vases. • Coal and oil are used to make plastics, paints and fabrics. • Wood and plant fibres are used to make paper. Look at the pictures in Activity 7.2 below. They show the raw material and the manufactured material that is made from each. Raw and manufactured materials have different properties. ACTIVITY 7.2: Describing the properties of raw and manufactured materials INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Study the photos of raw materials and the manufactured products that are made from them. 2. Compare the properties of the raw material and the manufactured material after it has been processed. Raw materialsManufactured materials Animal skin (hide) is used to make leather.

You have now learned that some materials are called raw or natural materials and some are called manufactured or human-made materials. We can group materials and matter according to how it is used. This grouping of materials is called classifying. ACTIVITY 7.3: Classifying materials into raw or manufactured INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the photos in the table below. How can we tell whether something is a raw or manufactured material? 2. Classify the objects into raw or manufactured material by placing a ✓ in the right column.

There would be no books, newspapers, magazines or even a sheet of music when you want to play piano. No paper means no more paper food labels or paper packaging. Not even toilet paper or kitchen wipes. Books are made from paper. Toilet paper is made from paper. 7 Paper is a very important material in our lives today. Let’s find out how paper is made. Paper is made from the wood and plant fibre from trees growing in plantations all over the world. A tree being planted. 8 A plantation of trees for making paper. 9 Did you know? In 2011 Sappi, one of South Africa’s leading papermaking companies planted 37 million trees in Southern Africa! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1152018/05/17 8:51:26 AM Matter and materials116 QUESTIONS What raw material is used to make paper? A field trip with the Quantum Club! The Quantum Club had just been learning about paper in their class. Walt wanted to know more about how plant fibres from trees are actually made into paper. So the Quantum Club decided to visit a paper mill to learn more about the life cycle of making paper. They were each given a diagram to help explain the papermaking process. You have also been given a copy of the diagram on page 117. The processes that take place at each stage were explained to the Quantum Club at the mill and Walt wrote down his notes. You will see his notes below for each stage – make sure you read these too! Walt’s notes: 1. Plantation • Trees are planted in well-managed forests. These are called plantations. • The trees are allowed to grow for several years before being cut down. • The main types of trees used to make paper are eucalyptus (gum trees) and pine trees. 2. Harvest • Once the trees reach a certain height they are cut down. This is called harvest. • The logs are cut into smaller pieces so that they can be transported. 3. Transport • The logs are all loaded onto big trucks. • They are then transported to the pulp mill. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1162018/05/17 8:51:26 AM 117Chapter 7: Solid materials117 1. Plantation 2.

Pulp mill • The logs are first debarked (all the bark is taken off) and then chopped up into smaller pieces, called chips. • The chips are mixed with water and other chemicals to make a soft pulp. • Pulp consists of wood fibres and water. 5. Paper mill • The pulp then flows to the paper mill. • At this mill the pulp is washed, bleached and cleaned before the paper is made. • The pulp is pressed and dried and then rolled or cut into sheets of paper. 6. Printers • The paper is transported to other buyers and printers in big rolls. • These printers make the paper into other products such as books, magazines and newspapers. 7. People • The finished products are transported to shops where people buy the products. • When people are finished using the paper products, such as reading a newspaper, they throw it away in the dustbin or recycle it. 8. Paper sorting • All the rubbish paper is collected after it has been thrown away and it is sorted. • Some paper can be recycled but some cannot, so the paper is sorted into two different groups. 9. Recycling • Used paper can be collected and used again. This is called recycling. • The paper that can be recycled is converted into other paper products. • Or it is made into recycled fibre which can then be used at the paper mill again.

Landfill • Paper which cannot be recycled is taken to the landfill sites where it is dumped. • Landfill sites have a negative impact on the environment. So it is best to try hard to reduce the amount of waste, which ends up at landfill sites, by recycling. After the field trip, Felicity was really interested in how she could set up recycling at their school to help reduce their impact on the environment. Mothusi showed her arty side when she made some earrings and a cover for her notebook from recycled paper. Phumlani was just happy that he had his favourite sports magazine to read, which is made from paper. Walt was really happy that he got to learn more about the papermaking process! ACTIVITY 7.4: The papermaking process INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Read through the diagram again that the Quantum Club were given at the paper mill and the notes that Walt wrote down. 2. Answer the questions below. QUESTIONS: 1. What are some of the final products that paper can be made into? 2. Which trees are mostly used to make paper? 3. What is pulp made of? 4. What does “debarked” mean? 5. What is a landfill site? 6. Arrange the processes in papermaking in the correct way. a. Chips go into the pulp mill b. Wood logs are transported by trucks c.

Pressed and dried pulp is rolled or cut into sheets of paper f. Wood is harvested from trees growing in a plantation g. Pulp is washed, bleached, cleaned and dried 7. Talk to a partner about the section of the papermaking process that interested you most. Explain why you find it interesting. 8. Do you think many people work in the papermaking industry? Explain your answer. 9. Do you think the papermaking process is a long or a short process. Give a reason for your answer. 10. Name two of the major papermaking companies in South Africa that you know of. We mentioned recycling as a part of the papermaking process. Recycling is a very important process as it allows us to reduce our waste and use things over again. Not only paper can be recycled. You can also recycle glass, tin and plastic. Bins for recycling. Watch out for these types of bins in your area! 10 QUESTIONS Is there a paper recycling project in your school or community? Why do you think we need to recycle paper? Did you know? It takes 40% less energy to make paper using recycled paper than to use new wood fibres Did you know? The idea of recycling isn’t new. Humans have been recycling materials for a thousand years! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1202018/05/17 8:51:27 AM 121Chapter 7: Solid materials121 7.3 Properties of materials Raw and manufactured materials have specific properties. We already looked at some of the properties of raw and manufactured materials by describing them. The properties of a material help determine (decide) how it is used. For example, plastic is waterproof so some rain jackets are made of plastic to keep you dry. A rain jacket made from wool or fibre would not be waterproof and you would be soaked! This is because the wool is an absorbent material (it absorbs water). Hard or soft? A material is described as hard when you cannot scratch it, you cannot cut it and you cannot dent it. Hardness measures how difficult or easy it is to change the shape of the material, either by denting, cutting or scratching it. A diamond is an example of a hard material as diamond cannot be scratched by other objects. In fact, diamond is so hard it is used on drill bits to drill through rocks and many other materials. A diamond is a very hard material. 11 The opposite of hard is soft! Think of wet, raw clay, which is soft and can therefore be moulded into a new shape. New words • waterproof • absorbent • hardness • toughness • compression • tension • flexible • force • fragile • X-axis • Y-axis • scale • vertical NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1212018/05/17 8:51:27 AM Matter and materials122 ACTIVITY 7.5: Exploring the hardness of materials MATERIALS: • Sharp steel nail • Wax candle • Metal coin • Plastic spoon or wooden pencil INSTRUCTIONS: 1. First make a prediction about whether you think you can scratch or dent each object with the nail. 2. Copy the table below in your exercise books and fill in your predictions. MaterialPrediction – can you scratch or dent the material? Scraping observations Denting observations Wax candle Metal coin Plastic spoon 3. Scrape the point of the steel nail across the surface of the wax, the metal and the plastic. 4. Try to indent (make a hollow in) each of the objects by pushing the point of the steel nail into it. 5. Fill your observations in on the table. 6. Now answer the questions. QUESTIONS: 1. Which of the three materials is the hardest? 2. Which of the three materials is the softest? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1222018/05/17 8:51:27 AM 123Chapter 7: Solid materials123 Tough or fragile? A material is tough if it is hard to break. Kevlar is used to make the bulletproof vests worn by police officers. This material will not let bullets go through. Kevlar is an example of a tough material. If you hit a metal coin with a hammer, there will be no or little damage. If you hit a piece of chalk with a hammer it will break into tiny pieces. The metal coin is tough compared to the chalk. The chalk is very fragile. Toughness measures how much energy is needed to break a material. We will test some everyday materials to decide which material is the toughest. INVESTIGATION 7.1: How tough are some materials? AIM: To investigate how tough different materials are. APPARATUS (Each group will need): • Container with a wide round opening (large jam tin or yoghurt container) • A square sheet (20 cm by 20 cm) of each of the following materials: – newspaper – photocopy paper – tin foil – wax paper – plastic wrap NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1232018/05/17 8:51:27 AM Matter and materials124 • Two thick elastic bands to fit around the container • Metre stick or tape measure • Metal teaspoon METHOD: (Each group will have to): 1. Each group must choose a material to test. 2. Place the material over the top of the container and hold the material in place using the elastic band. Make sure that the material is flat and secure. 3. Hold the covered container next to the metre stick. 4. Hold the teaspoon by the handle 10 cm above the top of the container. 5. Drop the teaspoon straight down onto the material. 6. Copy the table below in your exercise books and record your observations. Did the material dent or tear? 7. If the material did not break repeat the experiment by dropping the teaspoon from 20 cm above the material. Record your observations. 8. Keep increasing the height from which you drop the teaspoon by 10 cm until the material breaks. 9. Remove the broken material and replace with a different material. 10. Repeat the experiment. RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS: In your exercise books, record your measurements and observations in the following table: MaterialFinal drop height (cm) Observations newspaper photocopy paper tinfoil wax paper plastic wrap Set up NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1242018/05/17 8:51:28 AM 125Chapter 7: Solid materials125 CONCLUSION (What you learned): The energy of the teaspoon when it hits the material depends on the height from which you dropped the teaspoon. The greater the height, the greater the energy. The toughest material only broke with the teaspoon at the greatest energy. 1. Which material broke first and which material broke last? 2. Which material needed the least amount of energy to break? 3. Which material took in (absorbed) the most energy before breaking? 4. Which material was the toughest? Stiff or flexible? Stiffness and flexibility are ways of describing how an object behaves when a force is applied to it. A stiff material will not bend when you apply a force (push on it). But a flexible material will bend. When builders choose materials for building structures, sometimes they need flexible materials and other times they need stiff materials. QUESTIONS Copy the table below in your exercise books and fill in your ideas about stiff or flexible materials and where they could be used. Look around your classroom or home and find three more materials to add and also classify. MaterialStiff or flexible Where would material be useful? rubber glass wood plastic material NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1252018/05/17 8:51:28 AM Matter and materials126 Case study: The flexibility of rulers The Quantum Club use rulers a lot in class. Their teacher likes them to use rulers to draw straight lines so that their work is neat. Walt needed a ruler as his was broken. Walt noticed that his was broken and so was Mothusi’s, but Felicity’s and Phumlani’s rulers were not broken. Walt also observed that each of them had rulers made of different materials, either wood, plastic or metal. Walt thought that maybe the type of material that the ruler was made of might influence whether it would break or not. He asked his teacher if the material of the ruler made a difference to whether the ruler would break or not. Their teacher suggested that the whole class do an experiment to test the flexibility of the different rulers. Science investigations or experiments are used to answer questions! QUESTIONS 1. What did Walt observe? 2. What was the question he wanted to answer? 3. Why did the class do the experiment? This is the aim of the experiment. 4. What do you think the answer is to the question in number 2? Let us now try answer the question by doing a Science investigation!

APPARATUS (What you will need): • 30 cm plastic ruler • 30 cm wooden ruler • 30 cm metal ruler • 500 g mass • String • Clamp METHOD (What you must do): 1. Set up the apparatus as shown. The ruler must be clamped onto the end of a table. 2. Measure how far the mass pulls the end of the ruler down and record the distance in the given table in your exercise books. 3. Clamp the next ruler in exactly the same position and measure how far the mass pulls the end of the ruler down. 4. Repeat with the last ruler. Table Clamp Ruler Mass RESULTS: Record what you observed and found out: Type of rulerDistance moved down by the end (cm) a. b. c. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1272018/05/17 8:51:28 AM Matter and materials128 1. Which type of ruler allowed the mass to move the most distance? 2. Which type of ruler allowed the mass to move the least distance? 3. If the mass is able to move down, then it means the ruler has to bend. We have said that the measure of how much something can bend is its flexibility. Which ruler do you think is the most flexible and why? CONCLUSION (What you learned): What did you learn from the results of this investigation? Provide an answer to your original question. From your own conclusion, explain to Walt how you decided which ruler is most flexible. The class was so excited after doing the experiment that they did another experiment to test how the most flexible ruler behaves with different masses. INVESTIGATION 7.3: Investigating the flexibility of a ruler APPARATUS (What you will need): • 30 cm flexible ruler • Clamp • String • Any ruler • Six 100 g mass pieces • Graph paper METHOD (What you have to do): 1. Use the most flexible ruler and set up the apparatus as in the previous experiment. 2. Hang a 100 g mass piece on the end of the ruler. Use any other ruler to measure how far the end drops down. 3. Copy the table in your exercise books and record the distance dropped. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1282018/05/17 8:51:28 AM 129Chapter 7: Solid materials129 4. Add another 100 g mass piece and record the total distance the end drops down. 5. Repeat until 600 g are hanging from the end of the ruler. Mass (g)Distance dropped from start (cm) 100 200 300 400 500 600 RESULTS (What you observed): Use the results from your table to plot points on graph paper. We decided to change the mass hanging to the end of the ruler. With each mass the distance it dropped changed. When plotting a graph the quantity we chose to change (in this experiment the mass) is plotted on the x-axis. 1. Draw the x-axis, label it and choose the scale. 2. Draw the y-axis, label it and choose the scale. 3. Give your graph a heading. 4. Draw a line graph using your plotted points to guide you. CONCLUSION (What you learned): 1. Which mass piece made the ruler bend the most? 2. Which mass piece made the ruler bend the least? 3. What can you conclude about the distance the ruler moves (bends) and the mass that is hung from the end?

Other situations are where materials need to be strong in tension (be able to withstand pulling forces). The vertical (upright) steel poles of the water tower that are supporting a great weight have to be strong in compression in order to hold up the weight of the water tank. The rope supporting the bungee jumper needs to be strong in tension. This is to ensure that the rope does not break and that the jumper survives his experience!

What are these materials? 3. Observe and then describe the properties of the material, which is used in each ball. 4. Why do you think the material was chosen for each ball? KEY CONCEPTS • Raw materials are those which have not been processed and they come directly from natural products. • Manufactured materials have been made from raw materials. • Raw and manufactured materials have specific properties. • If a material is hard, it is strong and tough to scratch or break. • If a material is stiff, it is firm and does not bend easily. Stiff is the opposite of flexible. • Other properties to describe materials are strong, weak, light, heavy, waterproof and absorbent.

We can do this by changing the shape of the material. You may think that the shape may not make that much of a difference, but let’s have a look. Which shape is stronger? ACTIVITY 8.1: Explore different ways to strengthen paper MATERIALS: • Up to five sheets of A4 paper for each group • Pieces of sticky tape • Identical or similar size books for each group INSTRUCTIONS: 1. In groups, investigate different ways of using your paper sheets to balance a book. 2. Look at the pictures on page 138 for some ideas. New words • folding • tubing • corrugated • strut NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1372018/05/17 8:51:30 AM Matter and materials138 3. Use a piece of sticky tape if you need it. 4. How many different ways can you find of balancing a book more than 10 cm above the desk or floor, using only one sheet of A4 paper? You can try this on your own or in a small group. 5. Once you think that you have found all the ways you can do it, choose a member of your group to report back to the rest of the class. 6. With your teacher’s help, show each different method side-by-side on a table or on the floor at the front of the class. QUESTIONS: 1. Could you balance a book on just a single flat piece of paper? 2. Which shape of piece of paper is the strongest? Why do you think so? What did we learn from doing this activity? Materials can be made stronger by changing their shape. An example is rolling the paper into pillars. Pillars can be circular, triangular or square. Which one do you think is the strongest? Walt has a pile of books next to his bed at home. He wants to make a stand for these books so that his room looks a bit neater. He thought about making a stand using materials he can easily get hold of, such as paper. His idea is to make four pillars and then place a cardboard sheet on top on which to place his books. But, Walt does not know which type of pillar would be the strongest – triangular, circular, or square. Visit Different shapes for structures. goo.gl/Q9XLd NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1382018/05/17 8:51:30 AM 139Chapter 8: Strengthening materials139 Let’s help Walt and do an investigation to find out which shape of pillar is the strongest for him to make a book stand. INVESTIGATION 8.1: Which pillar is the strongest? AIM: The aim is what you want to find out. Write down what you think the aim is for the experiment. APPARATUS: • Four sheets of A4 paper • Scissors • Sticky tape • Piece of cardboard to form a platform (or the lid of a box) • A number of the same type and size of books METHOD: 1. Each group will make and test a different pillar, either circular, triangular or square. Look at the image below to see how to make the different shaped pillars Triangular, round and square paper pillars. 2. In your group, make four of the same pillars out of the sheets of paper (one sheet per pillar). 3. You can use sticky tape if needed. Check the amount with other groups so that you all use the same amount, otherwise it would not be a fair test. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1392018/05/17 8:51:30 AM Matter and materials140 4. Put a platform of cardboard on the folded pillars as in the picture below. A platform for the books using four circular paper pillars 5. Now go round to each group as a class and test the structures. 6. Add books (one-by-one) onto the platform. Use the same books for each group and place the books on in the same order each time. 7. Copy the table below in your exercise books and record the number of books that each structure can hold before collapsing. RESULTS: GroupsNumber of books Circular pillars Triangular pillars Square pillars Now draw a bar graph of your results. A bar graph is used to represent your results in a different way. Your teacher will guide you through the process. CONCLUSION: What is your conclusion from this experiment? Which shape of pillar is the strongest? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1402018/05/17 8:51:30 AM 141Chapter 8: Strengthening materials141 QUESTIONS: 1. Which shape pillar would you tell Walt to use for his book stand? 2. How did all the groups make sure that the experiment is a fair test? In other words, what did you make sure was the same in all the groups? Tubing and folding Materials are strengthened by shaping them into a tube (tubing). Tubing is often used to make frames and for supporting weight. The tube can be in a number of shapes, as we saw in the investigation. It can be circular, square, triangular or even in a U-shape. Square and round tubing When exploring different ways to strengthen paper, you discovered folding the paper also helped to strengthen it. Corrugated cardboard and bubble wrap plastic are examples of strengthened folded materials. Corrugated iron is another example of how folding makes a material stronger. Look at the picture on page 142 of a sheet of corrugated iron and a flat sheet. Corrugated iron is much stronger which is why it is used for the roofs of houses.

Braces across the corner joints in structures increase their rigidity and strength. ACTIVITY 8.2: What is my school made of? The Quantum Club need to investigate the uses of different materials in different schools. They have asked your help with your school. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. In groups investigate the different materials used in the buildings and structures in and around your school. 2. Look particularly for materials which have been tubed or folded, and for the use of struts and braces. 3. Record your observations in the table below in your exercise books.

Where are struts used? • How are struts used in building traditional homes? • Which materials are used to construct traditional homes? • Which materials are used to construct modern homes or buildings? • Where do we find struts in the human body? 9.1 Struts and frame structures In Chapter 8 we saw how to strengthen a material to build a strong structure, such as folding and tubing. Now we want to look at how we can strengthen a structure. A structure is something that is made or arranged in a specific way and consists of different parts. A jungle gym is an example of a structure. It has many different parts such as beams, ropes and bars. A jungle gym is a type of structure. 1 New words • diagonally • stable • rigid • tie • guy • brace • gusset • scaffolding • pylon • crane • bibliography • research NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1452018/05/17 8:51:32 AM Matter and materials146 A structure is made of different parts. The way we put these parts together can make a structure strong or weak. Let’s have a look at ways to join parts together. ACTIVITY 9.1: Exploring ways to make a strong structure MATERIALS: • Seven cardboard strips, all the same length • Paper fasteners (10–12 split pins) • Hole punch This is what split pins look like. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. You are going to make different structures using the pieces of cardboard. 2. Make holes at both ends of each strip. 3. Join the strips into a square and a triangle. Use the paper fasteners (split pins) to join the strips together at the corners. 4. Now test each of the shapes by pressing two corners together as in the picture on page 147 (don’t force them). Watch what happens. Which shape is easy to “squash”? 5. Cut a longer strip of cardboard, which will reach from one corner of the square to the opposite corner. Punch holes in it in the correct places, and add it onto the square. 6. Now press two corners together and see what happens. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1462018/05/17 8:51:32 AM 147Chapter 9: Strong frame structures147 Press on the square and triangle shapes as shown here. QUESTIONS: 1. Which shape lost its shape (collapsed) when you pressed on the corner? 2. How can we strengthen the shape that collapsed? 3. How many shapes are formed when the shape is strengthened with the extra piece of card? 4. What is the name of this shape? 5. Which shape do you think is the strongest? We saw in the last activity that you can make a shape stronger by putting an extra piece in. For example, the square was much stronger after you placed an extra piece of card diagonally from one corner to the opposite. This extra diagonal piece is called a strut. The other pieces are also called struts and together they all make up a strong frame. How struts make a rigid frame The frame is the structure that supports the other parts. The struts strengthen the frame structure when joined in particular, stable shapes. A frame is a rigid support structure that gives shape and forms support for its parts. The word rigid means stiff, not bending or changing shape. Every building, vehicle and piece of furniture has a frame structure. A roof in an airport where the structure is made stronger by using triangle shapes.

Human frame structure Did you know humans also have a frame structure? It is our skeleton! Your skeleton consists of bones, which make up the frame to support all our muscles and organs. Look at the picture below of the rib cage. It is a perfect example of a frame structure. The frame structure of the rib cage protects all the organs inside, such as the heart and lungs. The rib cage is a frame structure. How struts withstand compression A strut is a part of structure that supports or holds another strut in place. It can be a rod or a bar. A strut is designed to withstand compression. The picture on page 149 shows how wooden struts are used to prevent the fence from collapsing. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1482018/05/17 8:51:32 AM 149Chapter 9: Strong frame structures149 QUESTIONS The struts in this fence must be strong and solid to give the fence stability. Study the picture of the struts in the fence. What properties do you think the struts need to have to do its job? For example can the strut be made of something soft? Can the struts be flexible? Ties, guys and braces A tie is a connector that is designed to withstand tension, for example a nut and bolt. Nuts and bolts are ties that The arrow shows the bolt connect two parts together. connecting the struts together. A guy is designed to withstand tension. A guy can be a rope, chain or a single wire. For example, when you put up a tent you use guy ropes to hold down the tent.

Triangles are strong shapes, which do not collapse easily. By putting another support (called a brace) across a rectangle’s corner to make a triangle, the corner is made much stronger. Diagonal piece of wood A diagonal brace on a Another way of strengthening corner where two pieces of a corner so it can’t collapse, wood meet. called a gusset. Examples of strengthened frame structures We are mostly going to look at the parts of frame structures used in building something. Scaffolding and roof trusses When builders need to work high above the ground, they often use a frame called scaffolding. If this didn’t have NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1502018/05/17 8:51:33 AM 151Chapter 9: Strong frame structures151 any braces across it which make triangles, it could easily collapse. Construction workers use scaffolding. The next picture shows a roof truss. A roof truss is used to help carry the weight of the roof of a house. All of the triangles in it help make it strong. Top chord Metal gusset Brace Bearing point Bottom chord A roof truss. You don’t need to know all these names of the parts.

The diagrams below show the use of triangles to make bridges stronger: All the triangles in these bridges make them strong. QUESTIONS Why do you think bridges need to be so strong? Pylons and cranes Some structures are really big and carry a lot of weight. These structures include pylons and cranes. They must have very strong frames, so they use struts to make them stronger. Look at the photos on page 153. Can you see all the diagonal struts which strengthen the frames of the pylons?

Cranes need to lift very heavy objects, but they also need to be able to move around. So they must be as light as possible, but still very strong. A frame structure with struts is the best way to do this. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1532018/05/17 8:51:34 AM Matter and materials154 Crane 7 QUESTIONS Look at pages 82 and 83. How many cranes are there helping to build the city? Designing a strong structure The Quantum Club went for a walk in the forest near their school after class. Mothusi wanted to find interesting objects from nature to draw. So she asked the others to come with her for a walk. While they were running through the forest, picking flowers and climbing trees, they came to a river. The river was quite wide and they could not cross. Felicity suggested they turn around and go back. But Walt hates giving up and he felt he could solve this problem. Phumlani was running from one tree to the next to see how fast he could do it, Felicity was inspecting a small pond where some tadpoles were swimming around, and Mothusi had sat down with her sketch book to draw a caterpillar crawling along a branch. Walt sat down next to the river to see if he could solve this problem of getting to the other side of the river. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1542018/05/17 8:51:35 AM 155Chapter 9: Strong frame structures155 There must be a way to solve this problem! Walt remembered that in class that week, they had been looking at ways to strengthen materials, making them stronger to hold a heavier load. He remembered that folding and rolling paper into a tube made it stronger. He also thought about the struts used in frame structures to make them stronger, more rigid and stable. The next day in class Walt asked his teacher if they could design a model of a bridge to cross the river near the school. The teacher thought this was an excellent idea and decided to set it up as a class competition: To design and make a model of a bridge to span 1m between two desks and then test whose bridge could hold the most weight. Let’s also take part in the competition in your class and help Walt come up with the best design for a bridge to cross the river. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1552018/05/17 8:51:35 AM Matter and materials156 Do you remember the technology process? We are going to follow these steps when designing the bridge: 1. Investigate 2. Design 3. Make 4. Evaluate 5. Communicate Do you remember last term when you designed a shelter for birds? In that project on page 77, we only designed the shelter, made drawings, and then evaluated the design. Now, we are going to take this process further and actually make the bridge and then evaluate the products that we made! If you do not want to do this design project of making a bridge, there are other options that also use struts to create a strong structure, such as designing a model of a tower, pylon or chair. This activity will use a bridge as an example. ACTIVITY 9.2: Designing and making a bridge INVESTIGATE: The first step is to investigate and do some research around how to build a bridge. In earlier chapters we looked at ways to strengthen materials and create strong structures using struts. Remember this when you are investigating and designing your bridge! You also now need to investigate ways of building bridges. You can use books and the internet. Write down some of your findings from your research in your exercise books. DESIGN: Now you need to use the information you have found out to come up with a design for your bridge. Did you know? A bibliography is the list of information sources that you used when investigating or researching. Remember to write a bibliography for your research. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1562018/05/17 8:51:35 AM 157Chapter 9: Strong frame structures157 Your bridge has the following specifications and constraints: • It must span a minimum length of 1m. • It must be able to support a load (bags of coins or books). • It must be built in class. Answer these questions to formulate your design brief: 1. What do you need to design? 2. What will the size and shape of your bridge be? Remember that your bridge must span a gap of 1m between two desks. 3. What materials are you going to use to build your bridge? Make a list of all the materials you will need. 4. What tools are you going to need to make your bridge? 5. Are there any other specifications and constraints that you can think of for your bridge? Now you need to draw some designs for your bridge. Use scrap pieces of paper to do your first designs. Once you are happy with your design, draw your final design in your exercise books. Label your drawing showing the materials you are going to use for the different parts. MAKE: Now comes the fun part! You have to make your bridge according to your design sketch, and using the materials you identified. Do this in class. Once you have all finished making your bridges, set them up between two desks that are 1m apart. Now, let’s have some fun to test whose bridge can hold the most weight! We will only test one bridge at a time and use the same objects (bags of coins or books) to place on each bridge, adding one object at a time. This will ensure it is a fair test. EVALUATE: Answer the following question on the bridge that you have built after testing it: Did you know? When making your bridge, you may come up with a better design! So, leave some space for a second drawing at the bottom. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1572018/05/17 8:51:35 AM Matter and materials158 1. Did your bridge work? How many objects did you place on it? 2. Did your bridge fulfill all the requirements in the specifications given to you? 3. If you ever had to build this bridge again, what would you do differently? COMMUNICATE: An important part of the technology process is to communicate what you found to others so they can learn from what you did. Write a paragraph in your exercise books where you tell Walt about the bridge that you built, what worked and what did not work, so that he can also learn from what you did. 9.2 Indigenous structures When we say something is “indigenous” we mean that it occurs naturally in a place. Something that is not indigenous is exotic. We can say certain plants and animals are indigenous to South Africa, such as the lion, the elephant and the baobab tree. We can also talk about indigenous people and indigenous knowledge. This is when we are talking about ideas and knowledge that a community of local people have developed over time, and that is specific to the area that they live in. Now, we are going to talk about indigenous structures. This means structures for houses, which are built in South Africa by the people that live here. Types of traditional homes In South Africa we have a rich tradition of building homes from the materials available in our environment. Traditional homes have been built the same way for a long time. New words • indigenous structures • exotic • traditional • rural • hut • rontabile (rondawel) • matjieshuis NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1582018/05/17 8:51:35 AM 159Chapter 9: Strong frame structures159 Today these homes are mainly seen in rural areas. The building materials used are indigenous (grown locally) and the people collect the materials in their environment. Other cultures, such as the Inuit, also build traditional homes. Their indigenous material is blocks of ice. In South Africa, we have the traditional homes of the Zulu hut (uguqa), the Xhosa rontabile and ungqu-phantsi and the Nama matjiehuis. Types of traditional houses. The igloo is a traditional house to the Inuit. ACTIVITY 9.3: Identifying materials used in traditional homes INSTRUCTIONS: 1. In the above pictures of indigenous and traditional homes, each home has been constructed out of specific materials. 2. In your exercise books, copy and complete the table on page 160 for the materials used in each home. Then state whether it is a strut, beam or column.

Sometimes the structures of modern homes are based on what was used to build traditional homes. Look at the two structures below. The first ones uses reeds and branches which are bent to make the framework for the house. This is a traditional structure. Traditional and modern structures In the second picture, you can see the roof trusses for a modern home. Can you see the similarities between the two? For example, the shape and how the structures are made stronger with struts. There are also some differences. In the traditional house, the reeds and branches are tied together with rope. But in the modern house, the roof trusses are strengthened with gussets.

Discuss and compare the similarities and differences between traditional and modern structures and materials with your partner. 4. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the modern structure. 5. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a traditional structure. 6. In your exercise books, draw tables to show some points from your discussions: a. The similarities and differences in roofs b. The advantages and disadvantages of the modern structure c. The advantages and disadvantages of a traditional structure KEY CONCEPTS • Frame structures can be made stronger by using struts. • A strut is a solid bar joined into a structure to make it more stable. • Struts are used in roof trusses, bridges, cranes and pylons. • Skeletons are frame structures made of a system of struts. The bones are the struts. • An indigenous structure is a structure used in a traditional home. • Indigenous materials come from living plants in the environment. • Traditional homes of the Xhosa, Nama and Zulu make use of a framework of struts.

We need to understand what this means. A way to think of it is that energy can make something happen. ACTIVITY 10.1: Energy is the ability to do work Let us have some fun playing a game! INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Divide into groups of six and go outside for 10 minutes to play hide and seek. 2. These are the rules of the game: a. One person needs to be the seeker. b. The seeker needs to find a home – a tree or the wall will work well. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1662018/05/17 8:51:38 AM 167Chapter 10: Energy and energy transfer167 c. The seeker closes their eyes and counts to 20. d. Everyone else must hide. They are the hiders. e. When the seeker has counted to 20, (s)he must find the others and tag them by touching f. If the hiders can get to the seeker’s home without him or her seeing them, they can block themselves and cannot be tagged by the seeker. g. If the seeker finds a hider s/he runs to their home, touches it and says “1, 2, 3 Tag Thandi!” (or whoever they saw). h. If there is time left over, you can choose a new seeker and play again. 3. Return to class after 10 minutes and talk in your group about how you feel. 4. Each group must choose a leader who will report back to the class. 5. Write down the words that are being used to describe how you are feeling after the game. 6. Write down some of the descriptive words in your exercise books. This game requires that you do a lot of running. You might even get tired from it. This means that energy is being used to do work. We saw that we got tired from running and playing a game in Activity 10.1. We use energy for everything we do. So you mean even when I do a handstand I am using Energy? Yes, that is right Phumlani! Everything you do needs energy. Did you know? The word energy comes from the Greek word energeia. Energy is the ability to do work.

Think about what you do from when you get up in the morning until you go to sleep at night. Think about what happens around you every day. 2. Write down five things that you have thought about that you could not do without energy. We need energy to carry out all our life processes. Do you remember learning about the life processes in the beginning of the year? QUESTIONS Write down the seven life processes that are carried out by all living organisms. I love running around, but where do I get all my energy from? That is a very good question. Think about why you need to eat! We get our energy from the food we eat. We eat plants and the food made from plants to give us energy. We also eat the meat from animals to give us energy. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1682018/05/17 8:51:40 AM 169Chapter 10: Energy and energy transfer169 But where does this energy in the food come from? Energy in our food comes from the sun! 10.2 Energy from the sun Before going on with the rest of this chapter, let’s identify some of the new words we will be learning about. ACTIVITY 10.3: Word search INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Complete the word search by finding the words listed below. Your teacher will give a copy of the word search. Do not write in the textbook. 2. Circle them with a coloured pen or pencil. 3. Once you have found all the words, discuss with your partner what the words mean to you.

We call this energy solar energy. Sol means sun. Next term we will learn a lot more about the sun! The sun photographed by NASA When the rays reach the Earth, some reflect back into space. The Earth absorbs most of the solar energy. This heat warms the Earth and the air around it. Sun Reflection Earth Absorption Rays from the sun reach the Earth. Some are reflected and some are absorbed by the Earth.

Which thermometer had the lowest temperature? 7. a. Which of the two thermometers, black or white had the highest temperature after 10 minutes? b. Explain your answer in a. above. Uses of solar energy Without the sun, the Earth would be a cold place with no life. Energy from the sun has many different uses. Light and warmth We use the light from the sun so that we can see during the day. We use the energy from the sun to warm us. People use heat from the sun to dry clothes and generate electricity. Plants use light from the sun to grow Do you remember learning about what plants need to grow in the first term? Plants use light, water and air as requirements for plant growth. As the plant grows it stores some energy in its roots, leaves and fruit. We will learn a lot more about this in Grades 5 and 6! Plants use the energy from the sun to make food, such as these mielie plants. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1722018/05/17 8:51:41 AM 173Chapter 10: Energy and energy transfer173 Animals eat plants to grow The energy stored in the plants is used by the animals for life processes. These cows are eating grass to get their energy. Transfer of energy The transfer of energy from the sun to plants, to animals, to people is called an energy chain or food chain. It is a chain because each organism forms a link in the chain as energy is passed along from one organism to the next. The arrows show the direction of the energy flow from one thing to the next. Look at the example of the food chain below. GrassGrasshopperMouseOwl An example of a food chain In this food chain, the sun gives off light energy, which is used by the grass to make food. The grasshopper eats the grass. The mouse then eats the grasshopper and the energy is transferred (moved) from the grasshopper to the mouse. Lastly, the owl eats the mouse.

In your exercise books, describe the transfer of energy from one organism to the next. LeafCaterpillarChameleon 2. This food chain could be much longer! As more organisms eat the previous organisms, the food chain gets longer, and the sun’s energy is passed further along from one animal to the next. Look at the longer food chain below. LeafCaterpillarChameleon MongooseSnake 3. In this food chain, what does the mongoose eat to get energy? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1742018/05/17 8:51:41 AM 175Chapter 10: Energy and energy transfer175 Trees are plants and so they get their energy from the sun to grow. As it grows, the tree stores some of this energy in its wood. When we need heat and light at night and when it is cold, we burn the wood so that we can use the stored energy. Long ago before dinosaurs lived on Earth, plants and animals also used the energy from the sun to grow. Today some of these old dead plants and animals have turned into coal, oil and natural gas. Coal, oil and natural gas are called fossil fuels. We mine fossil fuels so that we can use the energy from the sun that was stored millions of years ago. When we use petrol or diesel to make cars or tractors go, we are really using stored energy, which came from the sun millions of years ago. We use petrol or diesel to drive our cars. KEY CONCEPTS • Solar energy is the energy from the sun. • We use energy for everything we do. • We get our energy from our food. • Energy in our food comes from the sun. • An energy chain or food chain is used to show the transfer of energy. Did you know? Some people have solar panels on their roofs which traps and stores the sun’s energy directly. It can then be used to light up their houses and heat water. We burn wood to get warmth from the energy that is released. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1752018/05/17 8:51:42 AM Energy and change and systems and control176 REVISION 1. What is solar energy? 2.

We saw in the activity that energy comes in many different forms, such as light, heat, movement and sound energy. Let’s take a closer look at these different forms of energy. Light Light is energy that travels in rays. Some of these rays we can see, so we call that visible light. Some of the rays we cannot see but we can feel their effect on us. We cannot see ultraviolet rays but they burn our skin when we are in the sun without sunblock. We can also not see infrared rays but we can feel how hot they are on our skin. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1782018/05/17 8:51:43 AM 179Chapter 11: Energy around us179 Living things need light energy from the sun to survive. Your body also needs sunlight to make Vitamin D in your skin. Without Vitamin D your body cannot absorb calcium, and your bones cannot grow and get strong. Light comes from a light source. Anything that produces light is called a source of light: • The sun is a source of light. • Stars are sources of light. • A fire is a source of light. • A candle is a source of light. • An electric bulb is a source of light. ACTIVITY 11.2: Having fun with shadows A shadow of an object forms when light cannot pass through it. Let’s see how many different and interesting shadows we can make! MATERIALS: • Different shaped objects • Torch INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs and find some objects around the classroom. Did you know? The moon may seem like a source of light, but it does not provide light like the sun. It only reflects the light from the sun to us.

One of you must hold a torch and shine it onto an object that you have found so that a shadow is made on the wall. 5. Your partner must guess which object it is from the shadow. Do not peak at the actual object! 6. Experiment in your pairs with one object and answer the questions. Can you make a shadow shaped like a dog? QUESTIONS: 1. How can you make the shape of the shadow bigger? 2. How can you make the shape of the shadow smaller? Heat Do you enjoy standing outside on a warm summer day and feeling the warmth from the sun on your skin? What about warming your hands on a frosty cold morning in front of a fire? You are feeling heat! We discussed that the sun provides us with light, but it also provides us with heat. Look at these lions enjoying lying in the heat from the sun. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1802018/05/17 8:51:44 AM 181Chapter 11: Energy around us181 Heat can be found in many different places. Anything that provides us with heat is a source of heat. Let’s look more closely at different sources of heat energy. ACTIVITY 11.3: Sources of heat energy INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the photos of some sources of heat energy below. 2. Can you recognise the source of heat energy in each photo? 3. Copy the table below in your exercise books and fill in the sources for each picture in the space above it. 4.

ACTIVITY 11.5: Observing sound energy around us INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Close your eyes and be very quiet for two minutes. 2. Be very still and listen to your surroundings. 3. Write down five different sounds that you heard. Sound is a special type of movement. Sound is energy that makes substances vibrate. Sound travels as vibrations that we can hear and sometimes even feel. All sounds are caused by the vibration of substances. QUESTIONS Use your dictionary to write down a definition for “vibration”. Sound can come from different sources. You can clap your hands, stamp your feet, talk, sing or play a musical instrument. Different vibrations will make different sounds. ACTIVITY 11.6: Use a ruler to make sound MATERIALS: • Ruler • The edge of a desk INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Put the ruler on the desk so that it sticks out over the edge. 2. Push the ruler down. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1842018/05/17 8:51:46 AM 185Chapter 11: Energy around us185 3. Pluck the ruler and hear the sound. QUESTION: You can see the vibrations of the ruler as it moves. Can you hear the vibrations? Stored energy Energy is also stored in some sources. Stored energy is the energy that is stored in our food, in petrol, in wood, oil and other chemicals. Batteries also contain chemicals that are used to store energy. This stored energy can be used for different purposes. Examples: 1. When we eat food, the stored energy in the food can be used by our bodies. 2. When we burn wood or coal, the stored energy is released as heat energy which we can use to keep us warm. 3. When we burn gas, we can use it to cook our food. 4. When we turn on a car, we use the energy in the petrol to give movement energy to the car. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1852018/05/17 8:51:46 AM Energy and change and systems and control186 Energy is stored in food. Burning coal releases the stored energy as heat. Natural gas releases When the cars’ ignition turns on, stored energy when it the energy stored in the petrol or burns. diesel is released. Transfer of energy Energy can also be transferred (moved) from one part of a system to another part. We use electricity every day in our modern lives. Electrical energy can be transferred from a source to the appliance or light bulb. QUESTIONS Write at least five examples of objects that need electricity to work. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1862018/05/17 8:51:47 AM 187Chapter 11: Energy around us187 Look at this photo of the light bulb below. Electrical energy is transferred from a source to the light bulb to make it glow. A light bulb gives off light In a torch energy is transferred energy and heat energy. from the battery to the bulb. Have you ever used a torch before? How do you think the bulb lights up in the torch? The battery is the source of energy in the torch. When the torch is turned on, the energy is transferred from the battery to the bulb to make it light up so you can see in the dark. This brings us to the next section. We can think of the energy in the battery of the torch as being the input energy, and the light energy that is given off by the bulb as the output energy. 11.2 Input and output energy Examples of input/output energy Whenever anything happens, energy is transferred from one component into another. People, machines and appliances need an energy input to work. They also have an energy output that may be useful. Let’s look at some examples. Example 1: A person is running a race. In order for the person to have energy, he or she needs energy from somewhere. Their input energy is the chemical energy from the food they ate. By running the race, the person is giving out energy in the form of movement energy and heat. Did you know? Fireflies produce light using chemical energy from their food! The light they give off is actually more efficient than that of a light bulb. New words • input energy • output energy • transferred NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1872018/05/17 8:51:47 AM Energy and change and systems and control188 Chemical energy Movement and heat energy Example 2: Your TV will only work if it is plugged in. It needs energy to work. While watching TV, electrical energy is the input, and light and sound energy is the output. Electrical energy Light and sound energy Example 3: A torch will not work when you turn it on unless it has batteries. The input energy for the torch to work comes from the chemical energy in the batteries, which is changed to electrical energy. The output energy from the torch is light and heat energy. Chemical and electrical energy Light and heat energy Machines and appliances We use lots of appliances in our lives. These machines and appliances need an input energy to make them work. This is usually electrical energy. The output energy (the work the appliance or machine does) is something that is useful to us. Let’s look at some examples. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1882018/05/17 8:51:48 AM 189Chapter 11: Energy around us189 ACTIVITY 11.7: Investigating input/output energy of appliances INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Below are pictures of different appliances. 2. Each one has an input energy (electricity) and an output energy, which is transferred to the surroundings, such as heat, sound, light or movement. 3. Look at each photo and write down the type of output energy that it transfers to the environment. 4. Some of the appliances may transfer more than one type of energy to the surroundings!

Work in groups to make music with your body. 2. You can clap your hands or stamp your feet. You can make clicking sounds with your tongue or puff out your cheeks and tap them. You can beat a rhythm on your thighs. 3. In your group, find interesting ways to use your bodies to make a short (one minute) music piece. 4. Be creative. Present your ‘body band beat’ to your class. 5. Some of you could even dance while the others make the music! 12.2 Movement causes sound In your body band, you made lots of different sounds. Every sound that you made involved you moving a part of your body. Many musical instruments use movement to make sounds. Let us look at a few common musical instruments. A man plucking the strings on a guitar. When a guitar string is plucked, the string vibrates and causes a sound wave to occur. The sound is amplified (made louder) by the air vibrating in the hollow inside of the guitar as well. We can then easily hear the sounds produced by the guitar.

As the drummer beats this membrane, the membrane vibrates and makes the sound we hear. A trumpet player in a marching band. 3 The trumpet player blows through closed lips into the trumpet. This makes a buzzing sound that causes the air inside the trumpet to vibrate. The vibrating air causes sound, which we can hear. Many musical instruments work because movement causes vibrations, which cause sound waves.

Different cultures have different musical instruments, which are part of their traditions. The instruments which were developed by a group of people and are used in a particular area, are called indigenous instruments. Indigenous instruments are unique to a particular society or culture. Although the instruments are different, they all work because movement causes vibrations, which cause sound. Examples of musical instruments Africa has a rich musical culture and many unique musical instruments. Some examples are shown below.

ACTIVITY 12.3: Design and make your own musical instrument The Quantum Club want to participate in the local Art Festival after the holidays. They want to make a band of four and participate in the section for Indigenous Bands. Any instruments used must be indigenous instruments, which are handmade. The Quantum Club want a variety of different instruments. Felicity can play the flute so she would like an instrument which she can play by blowing, like a whistle or pan pipes. Walt likes to play his electric guitar, but he can’t use this as the instruments need to be traditional and handmade. So Walt needs an instrument which he can play by plucking strings. Phumlani loves playing the drums and Mothusi likes to dance with a shaker! Check out their photo, which they had taken for their poster to advertise for the festival! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1982018/05/17 8:51:52 AM 199Chapter 12: Movement and energy in a system199 The problem is, none of the Quantum Club have an instrument to play. So you need to help one of them to design and make a musical instrument. DESIGN BRIEF: You need to design and make an instrument for one of the Quantum Club. Write a design brief where you say who you are going to help, and what type of instrument you are going to make. Assessment tool for design brief Criteria: The learner is able to: Maximum marks Write a design brief 3 Draw and label a suitable design5 List suitable tools, equipment and material2 List logical steps for making2 Make a model accurately, neatly and safely6 List improvements 2 TOTAL20 INVESTIGATE: The next step in the technology process is to investigate. Do some research about the instrument that you are going to make. You can use books and the internet to do your research. Perhaps you know someone who plays this instrument? We already looked at some instruments, what they are made from, and how they are played. Answer these questions when doing research about your instrument: 1. How do you play the instrument? 2. What is it normally made from? 3. Is this instrument part of any culture and their traditional ceremonies? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 1992018/05/17 8:51:52 AM Energy and change and systems and control200 4. What other interesting facts did you find out about this instrument? DESIGN: Now that you know a bit more about the instrument, you need to design how you are going to make your own. Your instrument has these specifications: • It must make a sound by blowing on it or by plucking strings. • You must be able to play at least two different sounds. Your instrument has this constraint: You must make it in class. Answer these questions: 1. What shape and size will your instrument be? 2. What materials will you need to make it? 3. What tools will you need to make it? Now you need to draw some designs for your instrument. Use scrap pieces of paper to do your first designs. Once you are happy with your design, draw your design in your exercise books. Label your drawing showing what materials you are going to use for the different parts. When you are making your instrument you might get better ideas to improve the sound. So come back afterwards and draw more to show what you really decided to make. MAKE: Now make your instrument in class! After you have all finished making your instruments, take turns to play them for each other. Perhaps you can even form your own bands! EVALUATE: Answer these questions on your musical instrument. Do it after you have finished making it and testing to see if it can be played. 1. Does your musical instrument look like your initial design? 2. How do you play your instrument? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2002018/05/17 8:51:52 AM 201Chapter 12: Movement and energy in a system201 3. Can you play two different sounds (notes) on your instrument? If not, why can’t you? 4. How would you improve your design so that your instrument makes a better sound or is easier to play? COMMUNICATE: Now, do not forget that we were trying to help the Quantum Club design and make musical instruments for their local Arts Festival! Write a paragraph in your exercise books where you tell who you decided to help about the musical instrument that you made. Tell them what worked and what did not work. This is so they can also learn from what you did, and make a great instrument to play in their band! Wow, thank you for helping us out with our band! We could not have done it without you! KEY CONCEPTS • Many musical instruments use movement input energy to work. • Many musical instruments have parts that can move or vibrate. • Sound is the main output energy of musical instruments.

In Chapter 12 you learned that if you pluck the strings on some instruments the strings vibrate and make sound. We can hear and feel vibrations We know that vibrations cause sound. But can sound also cause vibrations? ACTIVITY 13.1: Observing vibrations MATERIALS: • Deep glass dish or bowl • Cling film • Rice grains (or any other small, dry particles) INSTRUCTIONS: Part A: 1. Cover the bowl with the cling film. Make sure it is tightly covered, but not too tight to start tearing. New words • vocal chords • medium • vacuum • acoustics • eardrum • air particle NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2032018/05/17 8:51:53 AM Energy and change and systems and control204 2. Put the rice grains between the middle and the edge of the cling film. 3. Tap the cling film lightly. Do this away from where you put the rice grains. 4. Now tap it harder. Do you see that your rice grains are moving or jumping up and down? Set up for sound experiment Part B: Can you get the rice grains to jump using just your voice? When they jump you know the cling film is vibrating. 1. Hum over the bowl. Near the cling film but away from the rice grains. 2. Make your voice deep and try again. 3. Make your voice high and try again. 4. Hum louder. Hum softly. 5. Try shouting, but do not blow on the cling film or the rice. Sound must make the rice jump, not your breath. QUESTIONS: 1. What happens to the rice grains when you tap the cling film? 2. When you hum, the cling film vibrates. Explain why there is a vibration.

They do the job well! • Making a sound near the cling film causes the rice grains to move. • This means the cling film is vibrating from the sound. • Sound causes vibrations that you can see. Can we feel vibrations too? Let’s find out! ACTIVITY 13.2: How do we make sound when we talk or sing? INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Rest your hand gently on your neck and hum. 2. Make low humming sounds and higher humming sounds. 3. What do you hear? 4. What do you feel? The human voice and hearing There is a vibration in your throat when you hum, which you could feel with your hand. It causes the sound you make when you speak, shout or sing. Nostril Mouth Tongue Throat Vocal chords Can you see the vocal chords that vibrate to make a sound when we talk or sing? Did you know? The scientific study of sound is known as acoustics. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2052018/05/17 8:51:53 AM Energy and change and systems and control206 What is vibrating in your throat? You have vocal chords in your throat. As air moves over them they vibrate. As they vibrate they cause sound. Look at the diagram on page 205. The vocal chords are almost like the layer of cling film over the bowl in Activity 13.1 that vibrates. So we make sounds when our vocal chords vibrate, but how do we hear sounds? In your ears you have eardrums. Eardrums help us to hear the sound. Your eardrums act like the cling film. They vibrate when a sound goes into your ear. This is how you hear sounds! The human ear is actually made of many small parts. Your outer ear is what you can see on the sides of your head. Your inner ear is inside your skull and made of small bones. Look at the picture below. Can you see the eardrum that vibrates? This vibration then bumps the little bone next to it and the brain can read this as a sound. Inner ear Outer ear Ear lobe Eardrum Wow, that all sounds quite complicated! And it’s all happening in both my ears every time I hear a sound! That’s right Phumlani, the human body is amazing!

We call this material a medium. When you are listening to your teacher talk in class, the sound vibrations are travelling through the air to your ears. ACTIVITY 13.3: How does sound travel through air? INSTRUCTIONS 1. Get a group of your friends and stand in a straight row. 2. Stand side by side all facing the same way. Your shoulders must not touch, but you must be close. 3. Each one of you is an air particle. 4. Two more friends must stand at each end of the row. One friend is a vocal chord. The other friend is the eardrum. 5. The “vocal chord” must bump the first “air particle” and move back and stand still. 6. The first “air particle” must bump the second “particle” and then move back and stand still. 7. The second air “particle” must do the same to the third and move back and stand still and so on ... 8. When the last air particle bumps the eardrum, the eardrum moves and then stand still. So sound is able to move from where it is made to where it is heard by air particles vibrating and passing the vibration from one particle to the next particle. But does sound travel through other materials? ACTIVITY 13.4: Making a telephone MATERIALS: • Two old tin cans or two yoghurt containers Important! Ask an adult to make sure the tin cans have no sharp edges that might cut someone! • Some string (2 to 5 m long) NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2072018/05/17 8:51:54 AM Energy and change and systems and control208 INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs. Ask your teacher to make a small hole at the bottom of each of the tins. 2. You want to connect the two tins with the string. 3. Tie a big knot at one end of the string. 4. Pull the string through the hole in one of the tins. The knot must be on the inside of the tin. 5. Feed the other end of the string through the hole in the other tin. Feed it in from outside the tin. 6. Tie a big knot at the end of the string. 7. Now you have a funny sort of telephone! 8. Take turns speaking into the tin and listening to your friend speak to you. QUESTION: Why does this tin-telephone work? How does the sound you make get to your friend? After discussing this in class, write the answer in your exercise book. Let’s do another fun activity to see how sound travels through other mediums! ACTIVITY 13.5: Secret code through a wall INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs and make up a secret tap code: Maybe three quick taps means “hello”. You can make up words using taps. 2. Sit on opposite sides of a wall with your partner. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2082018/05/17 8:51:54 AM 209Chapter 13: Energy and sound209 3. Put your ears to the wall and talk with your tap code through the wall. 4. You may have to knock if tapping is too soft. Sit on opposite sides of a wall and communicate to your friend! Let’s summarise what we have learned about sound and how vibrations move: • Sound must travel through something. • Your voice can travel through air. • Your voice can travel through string. • The tapping sounds can travel through a wall. • We say that sound needs a medium to travel through. • The medium your voice travels through is air. • Sound travels through wood and bricks. • Sound travels very well in solids. QUESTIONS 1. Why does sound travel well through solids? 2. Whales communicate (talk to each other) under water, even when they are very far from each other. Explain how the sound that one whale makes travels to another whale. Visit Bell ringing in a vacuum jar (video) goo.gl/yjsj6 Did you know? After an earthquake people may be trapped under broken buildings. Survivors are sometimes found days after an earthquake. They make tapping noises against the walls which are then heard with sensitive equipment. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2092018/05/17 8:51:54 AM Energy and change and systems and control210 What happens when there is no medium? If you are able to watch the video of a bell ringing in a vacuum, then do so. Sound needs a medium to be able to travel. A vacuum is where there is no air or any other matter. So do you think you will be able to hear a bell ringing in a vacuum?! QUESTIONS Can sound travel from the moon to Earth? Why? Making sounds Sometimes you need to speak softly when you whisper a secret to a friend. Other times you need to shout loudly to your friend on the other side of the playing field! Sounds have different volumes. Also, a mouse makes a very squeaky, high sound. But a lion makes a low growl. The sounds that these animals make have different pitches. ACTIVITY 13.6: Let’s make sounds with an elastic band MATERIALS: The biggest elastic or rubber band you can find. (A hair band will not work very well.) INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs and cut your elastic band in one place to make one long elastic strip. 2. One partner must hold the elastic at both ends. 3. The other partner plucks the elastic to make it move. 4. Try to make loud and soft sounds with your elastic. 5. Try to make high and low sounds as well. (High sounds are squeaky like a mouse, low sounds are deep like a lion’s growl.) New words • volume • pitch • echo • megaphone NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2102018/05/17 8:51:55 AM 211Chapter 13: Energy and sound211 The elastic makes a sound when it moves. QUESTIONS: 1. Describe how you made the sound loud. 2. Describe how you made a high sound. 3. Describe the movement of the elastic band. In Activity 13.6 we have seen that movement causes vibration, which causes sound. Different types of movement cause different sounds: • When the elastic is plucked (pulled) hard the sound is loud. You can see the elastic makes big movements. • When it is plucked gently (pulled just a little) the sound is soft. You can see the elastic makes small movements. • When the elastic is looser and your partner’s hands are closer together, the sound has a lower pitch. Did you see the elastic move slower? • When the elastic is tighter and your partner’s hands are further apart, the sound has a higher pitch. Did you see the elastic move faster? What we have learnt about volume: • Soft sounds are caused by small vibrations. • Loud sounds are caused by big vibrations. What we have learnt about pitch: • A high sound is made by fast vibrations. • A low sound is made by slow vibrations.

(They must all be the same kind.) • Water INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Pour a small amount of water into one bottle. 2. Pour a lot of water into another bottle. 3. Pour water into the other bottles – all bottles must have different amounts of water as shown in the picture below. 4. Arrange the bottles from the fullest to the emptiest, like in the picture below. ABCDEF Water marimba 5. Blow over the mouth of the bottles or tap them with a pencil. 6. You have made a water marimba! 7. Try making up a song. QUESTIONS: 1. If you hit the bottles with the same strength, which bottle made the highest sound? 2. If you hit the bottles with the same strength, which bottle made the lowest sound? 3. Compare the sound made by the same bottle when you tap it gently or tap it hard. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2122018/05/17 8:51:55 AM 213Chapter 13: Energy and sound213 What did we learn from our water marimba? • The height of water in the bottle changes the pitch of the sound made. • When you tap a bottle gently or hard, you change the volume of the sound. How can we make sounds louder? Have you ever seen someone talking over a megaphone? A megaphone makes our voices louder and travel further. Let’s make our own megaphone. ACTIVITY 13.8: Making a megaphone MATERIALS: • Thin cardboard or stiff paper • Sticky tape • Pair of scissors Speak into your megaphone like this. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Roll the card or paper into a funnel shape. There must be a hole at the narrow end (about 5 cm wide). 2. Tape the card so that the funnel will keep its shape. 3. Neaten up the funnel. Use the pair of scissors to cut off any pointy bits at the two open ends. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2132018/05/17 8:51:55 AM Energy and change and systems and control214 4. If you have some extra paper you can make a handle for your megaphone. Decorate your megaphone. 5. Now you can speak or sing through the small opening. 6. Test the difference in loudness if you speak normally or into the megaphone. QUESTIONS: 1. The megaphone (also called a loudhailer) makes your voice sound louder. How do you think it does this? Discuss this as a class and write an answer down. 2. Is your voice really louder or does the funnel shape just make it seem that way? Many instruments make sounds louder in some way. Wind instruments (tube instruments) use a tube as a funnel to make sounds seem louder, similar to what you did with the megaphone. String instruments do the same, but using a hollow shape. ACTIVITY 13.9: Making sound louder with a box MATERIALS: • Cardboard shoebox or plastic box (margarine tub or lunch box will work well) • Elastic (rubber) band INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Stretch the elastic between your hands and ask a friend to pluck it. 2. Now pull the elastic band over the box. The elastic must be tight. If it is not tight use a smaller elastic or a bigger box. 3. Pluck the elastic. 4. Feel the sides of the box as the elastic vibrates. Can you feel that the box is also vibrating? You may put a few rice grains inside to show the vibration of the box. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2142018/05/17 8:51:55 AM 215Chapter 13: Energy and sound215 The box makes the sounds louder. Let’s summarise what we learned from this activity: • The box makes the sound seem louder. • The box vibrates with the elastic. • The vibrations of the box make sound inside the box. • This makes the sound seem louder. • Some musical instruments have a hollow shape. • The sound is reflected inside the hollow. • The walls of the hollow shape also vibrate as the sound echoes inside. • This makes the sound seem louder. Do you know what an echo is? An echo is when the sound bounces back off a surface and you hear it again. Look at the picture below. An echo occurs when sound bounces back off a surface and you hear it again. Did you know? Dogs can hear very high sounds. These sounds are too high for us to hear. Elephants can hear sounds that are too low for us to hear.

Air pollution is when smoke and chemicals end up in the air which means it is not good for us to breathe it in. Can you see the air pollution in this city which makes it look smoky? This is called smog. There are other types of pollution too, including light and noise pollution. Noise pollution is any sound that continues for a long time and is loud, unpleasant or harmful to our ears. New words • pollution • compromise • hearing- impaired NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2162018/05/17 8:51:57 AM 217Chapter 13: Energy and sound217 ACTIVITY 13.10: Identifying noise pollution QUESTIONS: 1. List five sounds that are very noisy sounds that can hurt your ears. Or just sounds that are difficult to live with. 2. Look at the picture of a very noisy environment below. Identify all the sources of noise pollution. A very noisy environment! 3. List some sounds that are sometimes not noisy, but can be noisy at other times. 4. Are there any noises at school that distract (disrupt or disturb) you during class? This is also noise pollution. 5. Think of some ways you could minimise the noise pollution in your class. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2172018/05/17 8:51:57 AM Energy and change and systems and control218 ACTIVITY 13.11: Role play about noise pollution INSTRUCTIONS: 1. You are going to role play a situation where noise may cause a problem. Do this in pairs. 2. Choose an activity that may be noisy. (Watching television, playing music, drilling holes with an electric drill, or any other activity you can think of.) 3. One of you must be the person doing this activity. You must have your own reasons for making the noise. You must also have your own ideas about how much noise you are making. 4. The other person must be nearby. This person feels that the first person is making too much noise. You must have your own ideas about what too much noise is. 5. Act out a discussion for the class between the two members of the group. Think about the following: The person who is making the noise has rights. The person who is complaining also has rights. Can you get along? Can you come to an agreement where both of you are happy? This is called a compromise. Each person has their own idea about noise. We need to get along with each other. No one likes to feel uncomfortable. Always be aware of the comfort of others. We also need to understand that sometimes noisy activities are necessary. Always remember: What is okay for you may not be okay for someone else. Loud noise can damage your ears Noise pollution makes the area we live or work in very unpleasant. Noise pollution can be harmful and cause permanent damage to hearing. Even music that is too loud is noise pollution. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2182018/05/17 8:51:57 AM 219Chapter 13: Energy and sound219 Most outdoor noise pollution comes from construction sites and noise from cars and trucks. If you live near an airport, there is a lot of noise pollution from the sounds made by the aeroplanes. • Loud sounds can damage your hearing. • Doctors have found that people who work with very loud machinery become hearing-impaired when they are still young. • They have also found that loud music can cause hearing loss. Powerful amplifiers and speaker systems can be bad for your hearing. Headphones playing loud music can damage your hearing. • Do not listen to very loud music, especially through ear phones. • Some people are born with a hearing problem and they use hearing aids to help them hear better. A hearing aid is very small A construction worker wearing and fits inside the ear of a ear muffs to protect his ears. hearing-impaired person. At times, noise pollution cannot be avoided. Some factories and building sites are noisy places. Animals can be harmed by noise pollution. A good example is the whale. Whales communicate with each other by making sounds. The sound can travel over long distances through the water from the one whale to the next. When there are lots of ships present, they make additional noise. Water carries these noises very well and very far. This makes it difficult for whales to communicate with each other. This can cause whales to get lost in the ocean.

So why do we not fall off the ball? • If the Earth is shaped like a ball, why does it look flat? • What is the difference between a continent and an island? • Are an ocean and a sea the same thing? 14.1 Features of the Earth The Earth is our home. It is the planet that we live on. Our Earth is a very special planet, which is why we can live on it. Let’s have a look at why Earth is special. Features on the surface of the Earth Earth is the place where all people live. The ground under your feet is part of the Earth. We live on the surface of the Earth. The surface is the outside of the Earth. Miners can dig deep tunnels under the surface of the Earth. Plants grow in soil. The soil comes from rock that was deep under the ground. Rain washes soil away and it exposes the rock. We say that the rain erodes the soil and the rock as it breaks little pieces off and washes it away. As the rain erodes the surface of the earth it makes hills and valleys, rivers and seas. The features of the Earth are the hills and valleys, rivers and seas. Look at the following photos showing the different features of Earth’s surface. New words • feature • erode • atmosphere • surface • ocean • continent • island NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2242018/05/17 8:51:59 AM 225Chapter 14: Planet Earth225 The Orange River There are lots of rocks in this landscape.

These habitats are influenced by the features of the Earth. Did you know? The longest river in the world is the Nile River. It is 6 650 km long. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2252018/05/17 8:52:00 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control226 ACTIVITY 14.1: Habitats on Earth INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the photos on page 225 again that show different features of the Earth’s surface. 2. Answer the questions below. QUESTIONS: 1. Name some of the living things you can find on Earth. 2. In the photos, where do the birds live? 3. In the photos, where do fish live? 4. Where can cattle live? 5. What kind of animals can live in deserts? A desert is a place with almost no water. 6. What kinds of animals live in forests? 7. A habitat is a place where animals can find food, water, shelter and have their babies. Habitats have unique features. For example, the rocky shore habitat has crashing waves and big rocks. Name four habitats that you have seen in the photos. 8. Name four non-living things you can see in the photos. The Earth has air in the atmosphere. Air is all around you and it moves. When air moves, we call it wind. You know when air moves because you can feel a wind blowing. When you look up at the sky, you sometimes see clouds. The clouds move in the air. Although you cannot see air, it is still a feature of Earth, like the rocks and soil that make up the mountains and hills. Or the water that makes up the rivers, seas and lakes. QUESTIONS Is there air high up in the sky? Give a reason for your answer. Are clouds all equally high? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2262018/05/17 8:52:00 AM 227Chapter 14: Planet Earth227 Clouds high in the sky. 4 Clouds nearer the ground. 5 Sometimes it is hard to see the features of the Earth if we are standing low on the ground. For example, you might be standing in a valley and then not be able to see all the surrounding mountains. Also, the features of Earth look different depending on where you are viewing from. Do you think a bird flying in the sky will view the landscape the same as you if you are standing on the ground? Let’s have a look. ACTIVITY 14.2: What do things look like from above? MATERIALS: • Pencil • Coloured pencils • Rubber INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Let’s look at what a bird sees when he flies over a boy. Can you see the bird flying over the boy in the picture? 2. Answer the questions that follow. QUESTIONS: 1. When the bird looks down, what does it see? Choose the right picture. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2272018/05/17 8:52:00 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control228 ABCD 2. Imagine you are a fly on the ceiling in the classroom. You look down and see the classroom. Now draw the classroom as the fly sees it in your exercise books. Draw the chalkboard, the cupboard, the door and the teacher’s table. You don’t have to draw the people. You can use some colour if you want to. 3. The next picture shows you a school as it looks from a bird’s eye view. The school as seen by a bird.

An aeroplane flies over the same school. This picture shows you how the school looks from an aeroplane. The aeroplane is flying higher than the bird. The school as seen by people in a low-flying aeroplane. 5. Find the soccer field now. Why is the soccer field much smaller than in the picture where the bird is flying over the school? 6. Find the shop. It is across the road from the school. What do you see outside the shop? 7. The aeroplane now flies higher up into the sky. You can now see what the town looks like to people in the aeroplane. Find the river, a road and a farm. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2292018/05/17 8:52:01 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control230 The town as seen by people in an aeroplane flying high overhead. What we have seen in this activity is that as you go higher and higher up, the objects appear smaller and smaller. So, when photos are taken from an aeroplane or helicopter, we get a better idea of the features of the Earth’s surface and we can see more. If we go even higher up into space then we can’t go in an aeroplane anymore. Then astronauts fly up in a spacecraft. In the picture below you see what South Africa looks like to people in a spacecraft high above South Africa. This is what people in a spacecraft see when looking at South Africa from space. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2302018/05/17 8:52:02 AM 231Chapter 14: Planet Earth231 ACTIVITY 14.3: Looking at Earth from space Now look at the photo. An astronaut in a spacecraft took this photo. Planet Earth. This is how the Earth looks from a spacecraft in space. QUESTIONS: 1. What shape is the Earth? 2. Find Africa in the photo. Point to it with your finger. 3. What are the blue parts of the photo? 4. What are the white things in the photo? 5. Where is Earth’s air (atmosphere), in the photo? 6. Is there more sea or more dry land on the surface of the Earth? Look at the photo and work out your answer. Continents and islands A continent is one big piece of land on the Earth. A continent has many countries. Africa is a continent with more than 50 countries. The Earth has seven continents: 1. Africa 2. North America 3. South America 4. Asia 5. Europe 6. Australia 7.

Do you know what a globe is? A globe is a model that shows what the Earth looks like. The globe shows you the continents of the Earth, and the oceans. The blue parts of the globe are the oceans. Sometimes it is hard to talk about different parts of the Earth without being able to see them, so we use a globe. A globe is a model that shows you where the continents are. ACTIVITY 14.4: Finding the continents on a globe MATERIALS: • Globe (or world map) INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Find the continent of Africa on the globe. Trace the edges of Africa with your finger. 2. Point to where South Africa is in Africa. 3. Find these countries on the globe or map: Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana. These are our neighboring countries.

This is what the continents look like, if you take the paper cover off the globe and spread it out flat on a table. Find the continents on this flat map. An island is some land with water all around it. Madagascar and Mauritius are African countries that are islands. ACTIVITY 14.5: Islands MATERIALS: • Atlas, globe or map • Information on an island of your choice • Pictures of this island • Colour pencils • Scissors INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Find an island along the coast of South Africa. 2. Bring information on that island to school. 3. Your information must cover the following questions: a. What is the name of the island? b. On which coast of South Africa do we find this island? Visit An introductory video to Madagascar. goo.gl/weSYp Did you know? Robben Island is a very famous island just off the coast of Cape Town.

Why is this island important? h. Why is it an island and not a continent? 4. Make an information brochure about the island in your exercise books. QUESTIONS What is the difference between a continent and an island? The oceans and seas Most of the Earth is covered by water, and you can see this on the map. When astronauts go into space, all the water on our planet makes it look mostly blue. This is why we call Earth the Blue Planet. ACTIVITY 14.6: Finding the oceans and seas MATERIALS: • Globe or world map INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Find these oceans: a. Indian Ocean b. Atlantic Ocean c. Pacific Ocean 2. Is there more dry land or more water on the surface of the Earth? 3. Find these seas near Africa on the map: a. Mediterranean Sea b. Red Sea Visit Earth’s oceans (video) goo.gl/nCx2x NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2342018/05/17 8:52:04 AM 235Chapter 14: Planet Earth235 An ocean is a very large mass of water which covers a huge part of the Earth’s surface. A sea is much smaller than an ocean and a sea is normally surrounded by land on some sides. Many people use both the words “ocean” and “sea” when talking about the ocean. But, when we are talking about the Earth’s surface, it is important to know that there is a difference between an ocean and a sea. 14.2 The Earth in space The Earth is a planet in space. From Earth we can see the sun, moon and stars. Space begins about 100 km up from the Earth’s surface. Space is a very strange and foreign place to us, which is why humans have been so interested in what goes on in space for thousands of years. There is no air in space either. It is a vacuum. I have lots of big questions about space. You probably do too! Did you know? 71% of Earth’s surface is covered in water. Did you know? The Mariana Trench is the deepest point in the world’s oceans. It is in the Pacific Ocean. New words • sphere • astronomy • gravity NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2352018/05/17 8:52:05 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control236 Let’s look more at Earth in relation to space! The Earth is shaped like a ball We saw that Earth is shaped like a ball. Something that is shaped like a soccer ball is called a sphere. We see the shape of Earth when we go very high and get far away from it. An astronaut in space can see the shape of Earth when looking out the window of the spaceship. But if we look out of the classroom window, the Earth looks flat, not ball-shaped. Long ago people believed that the Earth is flat, because it looks flat. It is so big that we can’t see that it is curved. Pretend you are an ant on a soccer ball. You are so small that the ball surface looks flat. You can’t see the other side of the ball, and you can’t see that it is a ball. Look at the picture of the ant on the soccer ball. All the ant can see is a flat surface. He does not even know he is on a round ball because it is so much bigger than he is. Ant is here Ball AntBall The ant on the ball sees a flat surface as it is so small compared to the ball. This is the same as us on Earth. We are so small compared to the Earth that when we are standing on the surface, the Earth looks flat to us. We cannot see that the Earth is actually round unless we look at photos of the earth taken from space! Did you know? The study of space has a special name called astronomy.

QUESTIONS Why don’t we fall down off the Earth, if it is a ball? ACTIVITY 14.7: Which way is up and down on Earth? MATERIALS: • Classroom globe (photos or a ball) • Pencil • Rubber INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Read this paragraph and answer the questions. When a pencil falls off your table, it falls because the Earth pulls the pencil with the force of gravity. The force of gravity pulls everything towards the centre of the Earth. But remember that the Earth is shaped like a ball. The picture on page 238 shows you how gravity pulls on things and keeps them from floating away. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2372018/05/17 8:52:06 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control238 This ball falls down at my feet. Which way will it fall? This orange falls down to my feet. Phumlani, Felicity and Walt are all standing straight up on the Earth. 2. Look at the globe again. Find South Africa and the United Kingdom (UK) on the globe. 3. Now look at the picture; it shows Phumlani standing in South Africa; when he drops the orange it falls towards his feet and he says that direction is the downwards direction. 4. Now look at Felicity in the UK. When she drops a ball, it falls towards her feet and she says that is the downwards direction. So for both of them, the downwards direction is towards the centre of the Earth. QUESTION: Find the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the globe in Africa. Then look at the picture above. Walt is standing in the Congo. Which direction will the ball fall from Walt’s hand?

There is a force that pulls objects onto the Earth called gravity. We are pulled towards the centre of the Earth because of gravity. KEY CONCEPTS • The features of the Earth are the land with mountains and valleys, the water in dams, lakes, rivers and seas, and the air all around the Earth or atmosphere. • Very big areas of land are called continents, and areas of land with water all around them are called islands. • Living things grow on the land and in the water. The Earth has many habitats for many different living organisms. • If we go up high above the Earth, everything looks different to the way it does when we are on the ground. • The Earth is a planet in space. Planets are spheres in shape. • There is a force that pulls objects onto the Earth called gravity.

Now that we have learnt about our planet, Earth, let’s move out into space and learn more about the sun! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2412018/05/17 8:52:07 AM 242 15 The sun KEY QUESTIONS • What is the sun made of? • What are stars made of? • How far away is the sun? • The sun looks so small in the sky, so how can it be bigger than the earth? • Why is the sun so important to us and all living things on earth? 15.1 What is the sun? We call the sun a star. But you probably thought that you could only see stars at night? And why does the sun look so much bigger than the other twinkling stars? This is because the sun is the closest star to us on Earth. The other stars in the sky are much, much further away. Let’s find out more about the sun. The sun during different stages of the early morning (dawn) when it rises. New words • hydrogen gas • helium gas • diameter • sundial Visit Watch crayons melting in the sun. goo.gl/59Emx NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2422018/05/17 8:52:08 AM 243Chapter 15: The sun243 The sun is a huge ball of burning gas Our sun is really a very hot, very big ball of burning hydrogen gas. The gas changes into helium gas all the time, and this change gives off energy which makes the sun very hot. The temperature of the sun is about 5 500°C on the surface. That is hot enough to melt rocks! The sun has dark spots on it that we can see with special cameras. The dark spots move on the surface of the sun as the gas in the sun is moving all the time. In the photo above, you can see that the sun throws out huge streams of hot gas. Can you see this in the bottom left of the picture? The sun is very much bigger than the Earth The sun may look smaller than the Earth up in the sky. But this is actually because it is very far away. The sun is far bigger than the Earth. ACTIVITY 15.1: Exploring the relative size of the sun and the Earth, as well as the distance between them MATERIALS: • Copies of the sun and Earth handout sheet • Measuring tape • A large room or a long hallway where you will be able to walk 20m in a straight line without many obstacles • Scissors INSTRUCTIONS: Visit A video on the sun goo.gl/PDHrD and sun spots goo.gl/JbKJR The sun looks like this through a special camera. Did you know? The sun is over 300 000 times bigger than Earth! 1. Cut out the images of the sun and the Earth. 2. To demonstrate the distance between the sun and the Earth at this scale, separate the images 20 meters apart. This distance represents approximately 150 million kilometres.

The Earth is actually very far from the sun. It is 150 million km from the Earth. That is 150 000 000 kilometres! It is a really long way from the Earth to the sun. If you went in a car at highway speed of 120 km/h, you would have to travel for 146 years to reach the sun. So, the sun is far away and it is very big and very hot. If the sun is so far away, why does it look as big as it does? The sun is so big that it is difficult for us to understand how big it really is. A model can help us to understand. ACTIVITY 15.2: Showing how far Earth is from the sun MATERIALS: • A grain of rice (broken in half) • Soccer ball • Space to move (playground or soccer field) NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2442018/05/17 8:52:09 AM 245Chapter 15: The sun245 INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the picture on page 245. 2. One learner stands in a place where there is a lot of room all around them. This learner holds the soccer ball. The ball represents the sun. 3. Another learner stands next to her or him and holds the half-grain of rice. It represents the Earth. 4. The learner holding the rice walks away from the learner holding the soccer ball with 24 of the biggest steps he or she can make. That distance is about 24 metres. The 24 metres represents the distance from the sun to the Earth. Half a grain of rice The soccer ball The soccer ball represents the sun, and the half-grain of rice represents the Earth. 5. Now the learner carrying the half-grain of rice starts walking to the right. He or she must always stay 24 m from the soccer ball. If you do this you will walk in a large circle around the soccer ball. This model shows us that the tiny Earth moves in a circle around the big sun. QUESTIONS: 1. Stand 24 m away from the soccer ball. Hold up one finger in front of you, and cover the soccer ball with your nail. Is the soccer ball really as big as your fingernail? 2. Why does the ball look as big as your nail?

In the picture below you can see how their sizes compare. Approximate size of Earth This is how the size of the Earth compares to the size of the sun. The Earth is not really this close to the sun. 15.2 The sun is the closest star Our sun is like the stars we see in the sky at night. Many of those stars are very much bigger than the sun. They look small because they are so very far away. All the stars are made of gas that is glowing and very hot. Do you know what a telescope is? It is like a big pair of very strong binoculars, which lets us view the objects in outer space. Without a telescope we can see about 2 500 stars, but when we use a telescope we can see millions of stars! Did you know? Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist, developed the telescope.

Look at the photo below and answer the questions. This is a photograph from NASA of the star cluster of Omega Centauri, showing all the different colourful stars. QUESTIONS: 1. Are there more red or blue stars in this picture? 2. Which of the stars do you think are the hottest? 3. What colour star is the sun? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2472018/05/17 8:52:09 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control248 Stars that look orange-reddish are not as hot as the sun. Stars that look blue-white are much hotter than the sun. The sun is the nearest star to Earth. The second-nearest star is called Proxima Centauri. Light from the sun takes eight minutes to reach your eyes, but light from Proxima Centauri takes over four years to reach your eyes. The Voyager 1 is a spacecraft that launched from Earth many years ago. It is travelling away from the sun so fast at a speed of 17 km every second! If Voyager were to travel to Proxima Centauri it would take more than 73 000 years to arrive! The sun is important to life on Earth Without the sun, life on Earth would not be possible. It would be completely dark and freezing cold. In other words, the sun provides us with light and heat. Because of this light and heat, life became possible. The sun sends out heat and light to the Earth. Earth only gets a small part of the heat and light that the sun sends out, but even that is enough to make us feel uncomfortable on a hot day! We hang our washing outside People used to tell the time to dry. The heat from the sun using a sundial like this one. 4 helps the clothes to dry. 3 QUESTIONS What else can you think of that the sun helps with on Earth? Did you know? Many early cultures saw the sun as a deity or god because of how important it is on Earth. For example, ancient Egyptians had a sun god called Ra. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2482018/05/17 8:52:10 AM 249Chapter 15: The sun249 Some people have special heaters on the roofs of their houses. These are called solar water heaters. They use the sun’s heat energy to heat water. A solar water heater on the roof of a house. The water is in the tank. 5 Unfortunately the sun also has harmful effects on Earth, and especially on people if we do not protect ourselves properly.

The nights were cold and the sun was low in the middle of the day. We are in the fourth term now. The days are longer and the sun is much higher in the middle of the day. Soon we will have summer. Then winter will come again. The seasons repeat every year in a cycle. Cycle is when things happen the same way, again and again. For example, do you remember learning about the water cycle in Term 2 in Matter and Materials? This is a cycle. Water evaporates from the oceans, lakes and rivers and becomes water vapour. Then the water vapour condenses and becomes liquid water again as clouds. Scientists explain why the seasons change in a cycle. They find that the Earth is moving around the sun. Earth needs a year to go around the sun once and come back to the same place. As the Earth moves around the sun, we experience different seasons. QUESTIONS Name the four season and place them in the correct order starting with summer. New words • orbit • leap year • solar system • dwarf planet • asteroid belt NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2512018/05/17 8:52:10 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control252 When it is summer ...it is winter in England. 2 in South Africa... 1 ACTIVITY 16.1: Making a model of the Earth’s orbit moving around the sun MATERIALS: • Strong string about 5 m long • Ball in a plastic bag • Four thick rubber bands INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Join the bag to the string, with four rubber bands. 2. Someone must run with the ball in the bag to help you get it going. 3. Then swing the ball on the end of the string around as fast as you can. The rest of the class must watch the plastic bag carefully to see whether the rubber bands stretch. 4. The learner swinging the ball around represents the sun, and the ball represents the Earth. If you look carefully at the rubber bands, you can see that the ball is pulling on the learner, and the learner is pulling on the ball. Ball inside Plastic bag Four elastic bands The ball orbits in a circle path around the learner. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2522018/05/17 8:52:11 AM 253Chapter 16: The Earth and the sun253 5. Take turns to swing the ball; feel how hard you need to pull on the bag to keep it going around. QUESTIONS: 1. What do you feel as you swing the ball? 2. If the ball in its bag could feel, what would it feel? 3. If the string breaks, in what direction will the ball carry on travelling? Point with your hand to show your answer. 4. Why can you not see a circle in the picture on page 252? Does the ball really move in a circle when you swing it? 5. The ball represents the Earth. You swing it quite fast, but how long does the Earth really need to go once around the sun? The planet Earth orbits around the sun in 365 and 1 4 days and we call that one year. As Earth moves to new positions around the sun, we have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring, and then summer comes again. Now in space, the Earth keeps on going around the sun at more than 100 000 km per hour. But there is no string pulling on the Earth, so what pulls on the Earth? Gravity force pulls the sun and the Earth towards each other. There is no string in space between the Earth and sun! The sun pulls on the Earth and the Earth pulls on the sun with the forces of gravity. The pull is so strong that it works at a distance of 150 million km! Like the string, gravity force keeps the Earth moving in its orbit around the sun, year after year. 16.2 The Earth and other planets Some of the bright things we see in the sky at night are not stars, they are planets. Venus (the Evening Star) is the easiest planet to find because it is big and bright. You can find it in the evening just after the sun has set, or in the morning just before the sun rises. African names for Venus are iKhwezi and Naledi ya masa. Visit Play a game to make the Earth orbit the sun: goo.gl/qIo4i Did you know? Every four years we have a leap year.

We can see thousands of millions of stars with a telescope. Stars are very, very far away from us. Stars do not orbit around our sun. There are eight planets moving in orbits around the sun Mars is another planet you can find on some nights. It has an orange colour. What are the names of the planets in our solar system? • Mercury • Venus • Earth • Mars • Jupiter • Saturn • Uranus • Neptune We used to call Pluto a planet, but not anymore. Now it has been decided that Pluto is not a planet. Pluto is now what is known as a dwarf planet. The decision to reclassify Pluto came after a long debate. Some of the facts which made scientists decide that Pluto is not a planet is that it is much smaller than any of the other planets. Pluto also does not have a regular orbit around the sun.

They used a rocket to go there. They walked around and they brought back some moon rocks.” The Quantum Club sit for a while longer, gazing up at the beautiful fireworks with the moon in the background. Mothusi breaks the silence, “I saw a video of the astronauts on the moon. They jumped around easily because they weighed less on the moon.” Phumlani then has a great idea, “Come on, let’s make model rockets. We’ll pretend we are sending someone to the moon!” Everyone agrees and Walt even says, “I want a little astronaut on my rocket – I’ll write my name, Walt, on him!” Now the Quantum Club want to design and make rockets. Their rockets will have a small model of a person on them. You must help them do this! We now need to write a design brief for our project. A design brief tells what you are planning on doing and designing. It is normally quite short. QUESTIONS Write down two things you know about rockets. Then write two sentences about what you are going to do. This is your design brief. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2652018/05/17 8:52:14 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control266 17.2 How do rockets work? The Quantum Club must find out some things before they can design a rocket. In this section, the Quantum Club are going to investigate rockets. In Technology, a designer must do research on what people have already made, and find out how those things work. We use the word “investigate”, which means find out. Felicity is reading up about rockets that have been built in the past. She is investigating! Investigate rockets that went to the moon People have used rockets to go into space and to travel to the moon. In 1969, a rocket called the Apollo 11 took three men to the moon for the first time. Turn to page 280 for moon facts in Chapter 18. Look at the pictures and read about the journey. QUESTIONS 1. Did the whole rocket go to the moon? 2. Which part of the rocket went to the moon? 3. How far did the spacecraft have to travel to reach the moon?

The wings of aeroplanes work only when they move through air. QUESTIONS Can an aeroplane fly to the moon? Give a reason for your answer. Rockets cannot move in space the same way that aeroplanes move through the air on Earth. So rockets need to move in other ways. Let’s make a simple model of a rocket to see how they move. ACTIVITY 17.1: Making a rocket from a match MATERIALS: • Box of matches • Four rectangles of aluminium foil (4 cm by 8 cm) • Pin • Paperclip INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Put the match on the pieces of foil and put the pin next to the match. MatchPin Foil, folded double 2. Wrap the foil around the pin and head of the match. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2672018/05/17 8:52:15 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control268 3. Pull out the pin. This leaves a tiny tube for gases to escape. 4. Now you have a rocket. It is almost ready to launch. All you still need is a launch structure. 5. Bend the paperclip to make a structure as you see in picture below. 6. Put your match rocket in the launch structure. Make sure the rocket points away from people. 7. Strike a match and heat the head of your rocket. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2682018/05/17 8:52:15 AM 269Chapter 17: Rocket systems269 8. Watch what happens! QUESTIONS: 1. A rocket needs fuel. Fuel stores energy. Do you remember what we learned about storing energy in Term 3? 2. Where is the energy stored in this rocket? So, what have we learned from this small model of a rocket using a match stick? When the match-head burns, it gives off hot gases. The hot gases try to expand upwards, sideways and downwards. To expand means to take up more space. The gases that expand escape downwards from the nozzle at the back of the rocket. The hot gases shoot out from the nozzle and as a result, the rocket is pushed upwards! QUESTIONS Do a drawing of the rocket going up. Add these labels to your drawing: nose of the rocket, tail of the rocket, nozzle, hot gases coming out. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2692018/05/17 8:52:16 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control270 The rocket goes upwards because the hot gases shoot downwards out of the nozzle. The faster the gases go downwards, the faster the rocket goes upwards. If the nozzle is very big, the gases get out too easily and so they do not shoot out fast. If the nozzle is too small, the gases cannot get out fast. So what is the best size for the nozzle? You can try different nozzle sizes for the match stick rocket to find out which one works the best. QUESTIONS What have you learned from this investigation? Investigate balloon rockets Have you ever blown up a balloon and then let it go. How did it fly? Did it go in a straight line? Probably not! It most likely flew all over the place! This is no good for a rocket. How do we make it fly straight? I have an idea to make the balloon go straight! Have a look in the next activity. Did you know? When you test something over and over again, and change it each time to find the best solution, this is called testing by “trial and error”.

Give a reason for your answer. 17.3 Modelling a rocket The Quantum Club is going to design and make rockets. To design means to use your knowledge and to think carefully about the thing you are going to make. ACTIVITY 17.4: Designing, making and evaluating a rocket INVESTIGATE: The first step is to always investigate. We have already done quite a few investigations leading up to this. Go back and revise what you have learned. DESIGN: 1. Now you need to use the information you have found out to come up with a design for your rocket. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2742018/05/17 8:52:17 AM 275Chapter 17: Rocket systems275 2. Your rocket has the following specifications and constraints: • Your rocket must move by itself. • Your rocket must go further than 1 m, upwards or sideways. • Your rocket must carry a small paper model of an astronaut. • The astronaut must have the name of someone in the group. • You must make your rocket in class, not at home. 3. Answer these questions: a. What do you need to design? b. What will the size and shape of your rocket be? c. What materials are you going to use to build your rocket? Make a list of all the materials you will need. The picture below shows some of the materials you can use. You do not need to use all of them, and you can also use other things that are not in the picture. The things you can use to make your rocket. 4. What tools are you going to need to make your rocket? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2752018/05/17 8:52:17 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control276 These are some of the tools to use. 5. Are there any other specifications and constraints that you can think of for your rocket? 6. Now you need to draw some designs for your rocket. Use scrap pieces of paper to do your first designs. Once you are happy with your design, draw your final design in your exercise books. Label your drawing, showing what materials you are going to use for the different parts. When you are making your rocket you will get better ideas so come back afterwards and show what you really decided to make. MAKE: Now make your rocket in class. Make your rocket according to your sketch and use the materials you identified. Once you have all finished making your rockets, test them to see if they go 1 m up into the air. Show the class how your rocket moves. The class will ask you how far it goes, and they will look for the little paper astronaut who rides on the rocket. Does anyone’s rocket go higher than 1 m? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2762018/05/17 8:52:18 AM 277Chapter 17: Rocket systems277 EVALUATE: Answer the following question on the rocket that you have built after testing it. 1. Where did your rocket get its energy from to move? 2. How many centimetres did your rocket move? 3. Did your rocket move in a straight line? 4. What could you have done to make a better rocket? COMMUNICATE: Remember, the last part of the technology process is to communicate what you found to others so they can learn from what you did. Write a paragraph in your exercise books, where you tell the Quantum Club about the rocket you built, what worked and what did not work. I really want to know what you learned about designing rockets! KEY CONCEPTS • Aeroplanes cannot fly in space because there is no air in space. • Rockets can move in space. • People have used rockets to go into space and to travel to the moon. • Rockets use stored energy to move. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2772018/05/17 8:52:18 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control278 REVISION 1. We cannot fly to the moon in an aeroplane. Give a reason why we cannot. 2. Explain how a rocket moves. 3. Give a reason why the nozzle at the back of the rocket must be small. 4. In which year did the first man land on the moon? NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2782018/05/17 8:52:18 AM 279 18 The moon KEY QUESTIONS • Why is the moon bright on some nights? • Why does the moon change its shape? • How can we find out what the surface of the moon is like? 18.1 Features of the moon Remember when we looked at the features of the Earth. Now let’s take a look at the features of the moon. Let’s go visit the moon! You already built rockets in class. Now let’s pretend that we are the astronauts on our rocket and we are going to explore the moon. The moon is a ball of rock in space The moon is very different to the Earth. The moon is not a planet either! It is made of rock and it moves around the Earth in a circle. Remember how we spoke about the planets which orbit the sun? The moon does the same thing – it orbits around the Earth. Full moon New words • crater • helmet • radio • protective glass NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2792018/05/17 8:52:18 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control280 QUESTIONS The moon has marks and shapes on it. What do you think those marks are? How could you find out what the marks on the face of the moon are? Moon facts: • The moon is 384 000 kilometres from Earth. • The moon is made of rock and the surface is rock and grey sand. • There is no air and no water on the moon. • The moon is smaller than the Earth. • People weigh less on the moon than on Earth because the force of gravity is less on the moon. • The sun is much further away from Earth than the moon. Exploring the moon In 1969, the rocket you see in the photo below carried three men to the moon for the first time. The rocket and spacecraft were called Apollo 11. This photo shows the rocket blasting off and going up into space. The rocket is as high as a 30-storey building. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2802018/05/17 8:52:18 AM 281Chapter 18: The moon281 The flame at the bottom is the hot gases coming out of the nozzle. Clouds on the side of the photo are the gases that hit the ground and blow dust everywhere. The three astronauts were in a small spacecraft on the nose of the rocket. The big rocket burned up all its fuel, fell back to Earth, and landed in the sea. But the small spacecraft with the astronauts inside went on by itself to the moon. This is the spacecraft that went to the moon and landed there. Let us imagine that we are in that rocket! We travel through Space at 5 800 km per hour. After three days’ travel, we reach the moon. We can see that the moon is round, like a ball. We can see that the surface is rough, with mountains and many craters. The surface is the outside of an object. You can rub your hand on the surface of your desk. A crater is a hole that was caused by something hitting a surface. If you throw a stone into sand, you make a crater in the sand. What do we find on the moon? Read this story, or listen while your teacher reads it aloud: The spacecraft goes down slowly to the moon’s surface, blowing out a big cloud of dust. There is no air on the moon. So the dust quickly falls back to the ground. We put on our space suits. We have air in tanks to breathe, radios to talk to each other with, and special glass helmets to protect our eyes from the sun. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2812018/05/17 8:52:19 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control282 An astronaut in his space suit walking on the moon. The ground under our feet is grey sand, dust and small rocks. The craters that we see are big holes in the surface of the moon. Rocks that travel very fast through space sometimes smash into the moon. In the places where the rocks hit, they make a hole and a ring of sand. The sky is black, not blue. We can see the stars and the sun at the same time. The sun is bright, much brighter than on Earth, and we are glad we have protective glass in our helmets! As we walk around on the moon, the temperature of the ground is hotter than boiling water. But if we stop in the shade of a big rock or the spacecraft, the temperature is much colder than ice. The temperature changes so much because the moon has no air. On Earth, the air keeps the Earth’s surface from getting too hot or too cold. ACTIVITY 18.1: I am an astronaut on the moon QUESTIONS: 1. Why is the astronaut in the picture wearing a glass mask that covers his whole face? Could he just wear normal glasses? Explain your answer. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2822018/05/17 8:52:19 AM 283Chapter 18: The moon283 2. He is carrying a big pack on his back. Think of three things that are in the pack. You can work out the answers by discussing the story. 3. The sand on the moon appears to have a light colour. Why does the moon give us light at night? 4. Make a drawing of yourself on the moon. Write a heading for your picture: This picture shows me on the moon. Show the protective suit that you wear, and write labels for the parts of your protective suit. This is the Earth seen from the surface of the moon. 18.2 The phases of the moon A phase is a period of time. For example, you are now in the Intermediate Phase at school. In Grade 7 you will be in the Senior Phase. As the moon orbits around the Earth it appears as though the moon is changing its shape in the sky. The moon changes from a thin crescent to a full circle or disk (full moon) and then it shrinks back to a thin crescent again. It is then not visible for a few days again. These changes in the moon’s shape are called the moon’s phases. New words • phase • crescent • waxing • waning • eclipse NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2832018/05/17 8:52:19 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control284 Why are there phases of the moon? From Earth we only see one side of the moon. If you were to stand on the moon and look at the Earth you would see our planet in the same position every time. This is why many people think that the moon does not rotate. The moon rotates on its own axis in the same amount of time it takes to orbit the Earth once. It takes the moon about 28 days to complete one rotation and revolve around the Earth. The moon changes shape each night as the Earth is casting a shadow on the moon. Depending on the position of the moon, the Earth and the sun, the Earth blocks the sun’s light from reaching the moon and therefore casts a shadow. As the moon moves around the Earth different shadows will be cast on the moon from the Earth. This makes it look like it is changing shape. Why does the moon change shape during the month? The sun shines on the moon but there is always a part of the moon that the sun cannot reach. We can see the part that has sunlight on it, but we cannot see the dark part that is in shadow. New moon Waxing crescent First quarter Waxing gibbous Full moon Waning gibbous Third quarter Waning crescent NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2842018/05/17 8:52:19 AM 285Chapter 18: The moon285 ACTIVITY 18.2: Make a model of the Earth, sun and moon This model will help you understand why the moon’s shape changes during the month. MATERIALS: • Small ball to represent the moon • A sunny day! INSTRUCTIONS: 1. You must do this activity outside, early in the morning while the sun is still low. 2. Begin with your back to the sun. 3. Hold out your “moon” in front of you, as you see in the picture. 4. Your head is the Earth and your nose is Africa. You are looking from Africa. Which phase of the model moon do you see? Light from the real sun I’m on Earth and I can see a full moon! How to hold the “moon” with the sun behind you. 5. Keep your arm stretched out and swing around until the model moon is between you and the sun. Now you see only the shadow side of your “moon”. You are seeing new moon. 6. Keep your arm stretched out and move the “moon” to your right until a little sunlight shines on the side of the “moon”. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2852018/05/17 8:52:20 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control286 7. Which shape of the moon do you have now? Point to the picture on page 284 showing the moon phases. 8. Turn more to your right until half the moon has light on it. Which shape are you seeing now? 9. Turn your back to the sun, so that you see light all over the side of the moon. This is like 14 days passing. Which shape of the moon do you have now? 10. Turn further to your right. Which phase is this? This is like 21 days passing. QUESTIONS: 1. If it were new moon tonight, how many days will it take for the moon to be full again? 2. How many days will it take for the moon to be a new moon again? ACTIVITY 18.3: Observing the moon’s phases MATERIALS: • Pencil to draw • Recording sheet INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the moon at the same time every night, for a month. 2. Copy the recording sheet on page 287 in your exercise books. Write the date in the relevant block for the week in the recording sheet. 3. Make a drawing of the shape you see every night. 4. See if you can identify the name of the phase and write that in the block below your drawing. 5. If you cannot see the moon due to bad weather, then write “Bad weather” in the block instead.

These stories tell us about the importance of the moon in people’s lives. Here are some stories about the moon from different cultures. The moon and the hare The hare and the moon met at a water-hole one night. The hare washed his face with water. The water became still, like a mirror. He saw himself in the water and then he saw that the moon was more beautiful than he was. So the hare took mud from the side of the pool and he threw it on the moon’s face. You can still see the mud on the face of the moon, if you look at the moon tonight! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2872018/05/17 8:52:20 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control288 QUESTIONS 1. What do you think the people who told this story were looking at on the moon when they described the “mud” on the moon’s face? 2. Do you think it was right that the hare threw mud at the moon? 3. What emotion was the hare experiencing? The moon and the sun Once upon a time the sun and the moon were married and they had many children known as stars. The sun was very fond of his children and he always wanted to hold them. But he was very hot and so the stars got burnt. The stars did not like to be burnt and so they always ran away to hide when he came up into the sky. But the stars liked to be with their mother, the moon, because she was the cool one. The moon had markings on her face and she was beautiful. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2882018/05/17 8:52:20 AM 289Chapter 18: The moon289 This made the sun very jealous, and he was angry with the moon. So that is the reason why the sun chases the moon out of the sky. On some days you can see her in the daytime but the sun almost never catches her. The sun chasing the moon across the sky. QUESTIONS 1. In this story, who is the father, who is the mother, and who are the stars? 2. In this story, what happens in the morning when the sun comes up? 3. How do you know that this story is not true? 4. The story does help us remember some true facts. Name one of the true facts we get from the story. 5. Why are the sun and the other stars hot? 6. In the real sky, why do the stars disappear when the sun comes up? 7. In the real sky, can you ever see the moon in daytime? Did you know? There are times when the moon comes between the sun and the Earth, and we see the sun go dark. These events are called eclipses of the sun. NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2892018/05/17 8:52:21 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control290 KEY CONCEPTS • The moon is a ball of rock. • It moves through space and goes around the Earth. • It reflects light from the sun onto the Earth. • The moon has phases due to its position in relation to the sun and the Earth. That’s all! You are done with Grade 4! NatSci&Tech_Gr4_Book.indb 2902018/05/17 8:52:22 AM 291Chapter 18: The moon291 REVISION 1. What is the moon made of? 2. Why does the moon give us light at night? 3. How many days must pass between a night when the moon is full and the next full moon? 4. When we see a half-moon it looks like a letter D. Why can we see only half of the moon? 5. What do we call the changing pattern of shapes of the moon during the month? 6. Arrange the Earth, the sun and the moon in order from biggest to smallest.

The number symbol can be built up with place value cards: In the number symbol 7 465 we cannot see the place value parts 7 000, 400 and 60. The 000 of the 7 000, the 00 of the 400 and the 0 of the 60 are hidden. Instead of 7 000, only “7” is written in the number symbol. Instead of 400, only “4” is written in the number symbol. Instead of 60, only “6” is written in the number symbol. 1. Write the number symbols for these numbers. (a) seven thousand nine hundred and forty-eight (b) six thousand eight hundred and fifty-three (c) one thousand and forty-five (d) three thousand nine hundred and seventy-five (e) four thousand and eight The place value parts of 7 465 are 7 000, 400, 60 and 5. 2.

For example, we can write 23 < 24 and 1 999 < 9 991. The > sign for “bigger than” can be used to state that one number is bigger than another. For example, we can write 24 > 23 and 3 492 > 1 274. Notice that the open part of the sign is always towards the bigger number. 7. In each case decide which is the bigger of the two numbers. Use the < or > sign to write your answers.

A number sentence like this is called a statement of equivalence. The number sentence tells us that two different actions will produce the same result. This number sentence can also be written in symbols: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 8 × 10 = 5 × 16 is a shorter sentence that gives the same information. 1. Write each number sentence in symbols. (a) Adding up 20 fives gives the same result as adding up 10 tens. (b) 25 times 8 gives the same result as 4 times 50. (c) The difference between 930 and 970 is the same as the difference between 430 and 470. 2. Which of these number sentences are false? (a) 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 (b) 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 (c) 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 (d) 9 × 6 = 6 × 9 (e) 5 × 6 = 6 × 5 (f) 9 × 9 = 6 × 6 When numbers are multiplied, any of the numbers can be taken first. The answer is the same. “False” means not true.

To avoid confusion like this, people all over the world follow certain agreements about instructions. If instructions include only addition and subtraction, the calculations are done from left to right. Example: 12 − 3 + 5 − 2 means you have to do this: 12 − 3 = 9 9 + 5 = 14 14 − 2 = 12 If instructions include multiplication, all multiplications are done before additions and subtractions.

To know how far you walked in total on that day you have to find the sum of the two numbers: 3 200 + 4 600 = 7 800 We can also say you add 4 600 to 3 200. To know how much farther you walked in the afternoon than in the morning, you have to find the difference between the two numbers: 4 600 − 3 200 = 1 400 We can also say you subtract 3 200 from 4 600. 1.

One of the things you can do is to use your knowledge of doubles. For example, you may not know immediately how much 70 + 80 is. But if you know that 70 + 70 = 140, you can add 10 and then you know that 70 + 80 = 150. If you do not quickly know how much 25 + 28 is, your knowledge that 25 + 25 = 50 can help you, for example like this: 28 is 3 more than 25, so 25 + 28 is 3 more than 25 + 25. So, 25 + 28 = 50 + 3 = 53. If you do not know how much 40 + 70 is, your knowledge that 40 + 40 = 80 can help you like this: Because 70 is 30 more than 40, 40 + 70 is 30 more than 40 + 40, so 40 + 70 is 80 + 30, which is 110. 3.

Work like in the above example to calculate each of the following: (a) 7 178 − 3 535 (b) 6 572 − 1 944 (c) 9 062 − 5 368 (d) 7 869 − 2 543 Here is a different way to subtract 2 543 from 7 869: 7 869 is 7 000 + 800 + 60 + 9 and 2 543 is 2 000 + 500 + 40 + 3. To calculate 7 869 − 2 543, you can subtract 2 000 from 7 000, 500 from 800, 40 from 60, 3 from 9, and then put the answers together to build up the answer for 7 869 − 2 543. 3. Use the above method to calculate the following: (a) 8 856 − 3 243 (b) 6 876 − 1 542 3 0004 0005 0006 000 Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 352016/12/15 1:13:20 PM 36 UNiT 3: WhoLe NUMberS: ADDiTioN AND SUbTrACTioN 4. What are the missing numbers in these number sentences? (a) 7 000 + . . . . = 7 543 (b) 6 999 + . . . . = 7 543 A difficulty arises when we try to calculate 7 543 − 2 866 by breaking down both numbers into place value parts. 7 543 is 7 000 + 500 + 40 + 3 and 2 866 is 2 000 + 800 + 60 + 6. Now you will have to subtract 2 000 from 7 000, 800 from 500, 60 from 40 and 6 from 3. Can you do this? One way to deal with this difficulty is to keep in mind that 7 543 = 544 + 6 999, and to then first subtract 2 866 from 6 999. 5. (a) Calculate 6 999 − 2 866 by breaking down both numbers into place value parts. (b) What do you have to add to your answer for 6 999 − 2 866, to get the correct answer for 7 543 − 2 866? Do that. (c) Add 2 866 to your answer for (b) to check whether your answer for 7 543 − 2 866 is correct. 6. Calculate the following in the way you have just calculated 7 543 − 2 866. (a) 6 435 − 2 787 (b) 9 362 − 4 876 Another way to calculate 7 543 − 2 866 is to replace 7 000 + 500 + 40 + 3 with 6 000 + 1 400 + 130 + 13. 7. Check whether 7 000 + 500 + 40 + 3 is equal to 6 000 + 1 400 + 130 + 13. 8. Calculate 7 543 − 2 866 by subtracting the place value parts of 2 866 from 13, 130, 1 400 and 6 000.

Write each of these numbers in expanded notation. Then change the expanded notation to a form that will make it easy to subtract 5 898 from the number. (a) 8 432 (b) 9 014 (c) 7 566 (d) 8 141 10. How much is each of the following? You can use any method. (a) 8 432 − 5 898 (b) 9 014 − 5 898 (c) 7 566 − 5 898 (d) 8 141 − 5 898 3.6 Use brackets to describe your thinking When you want to calculate 8 235 − 4 789 by breaking down both numbers into their place value parts, you will have to replace 8 000 + 200 + 30 + 5 by something else to make it easy to subtract the parts from the parts. Your thinking to do this can be shown in the following ways: 8 235 = 8 000 + 200 + 30 + 5 = 7 000 + 1 000 + 100 + 100 + 20 + 10 + 5 = 7 000 + 1 100 + 120 + 15 Another way to show how you are thinking is to use brackets: 8 235 = 8 000 + 200 + 30 + 5 = (7 000 + 1 000) + (100 + 100) + (20 + 10) + 5 = 7 000 + (1 000 + 100) + (100 + 20) + (10 + 5) = 7 000 + 1 100 + 120 + 15 To “transfer” means to move something; to take it from one place to another.

Use brackets to show how you would think to replace 9 000 + 200 + 40 + 5 to make it easier to calculate 9 245 − 3 678 by breaking down both numbers into place value parts. 2. Use signs instead of brackets to describe the thinking that is shown below. 6 425 = 6 000 + 400 + 20 + 5 = (5 000 + 1 000) + (300 + 100) + (10 + 10) + 5 = 5 000 + (1 000 + 300) + (100 + 10) + 15 = 5 000 + 1 300 + 110 + 15 To add numbers you can break them down into their place value parts. You can then rearrange and recombine the place value parts and build up the answer. For example, to calculate 5 235 + 3 352 you can think as follows: 5 235 + 3 352 = 5 000 + 200 + 30 + 5 + 3 000 + 300 + 50 + 2 = 5 000 + 3 000 + 200 + 300 + 30 + 50 + 5 + 2 = 8 000 + 500 + 80 + 7 = 8 587 3. Use brackets to show how 5 235 + 3 352 was calculated in the above example. 4. You can write in any way you prefer to do these calculations. (a) 4 253 + 5 163 (b) 6 134 + 2 655 In some cases there is a slight problem. For example, when you calculate 2 768 + 3 547 in the way shown above, you end up with 2 000 + 3 000 + 700 + 500 + 60 + 40 + 8 + 7 = 5 000 + 1 200 + 100 + 15 This must be replaced with the normal expanded notation before the answer can be built up: 1 000 100 10 5 000 + 1 200 + 100 + 15 = 6 000 + 300 + 10 + 5 = 6 315 Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 382016/12/15 1:13:20 PM GrADe 5: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 39 5. Write the following in the normal expanded notation. (a) 6 000 + 1 700 + 180 + 16 (b) 3 000 + 1 100 + 120 + 11 (c) 6 000 + 1 300 + 340 + 23 6. Calculate each of the following by first breaking down both numbers into their place value parts. (a) 3 489 + 4 786 (b) 2 784 + 4 562 (c) 5 287 + 2 496 (d) 3 987 + 2 565 It is quite fortunate that numbers can be added in any order. For example, to calculate 20 + 30 + 40 it does not matter whether you do (20 + 30) + 40 = 50 + 40 or (30 + 40) + 20 = 70 + 20 or (20 + 40) + 30 = 60 + 30. The answer is 90 in all three cases. 7. Work out each total in the easiest way that you can. (a) 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 70 + 80 + 90 (b) 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 70 + 80 + 90 (c) 300 + 400 + 500 + 600 + 700 + 800 + 900 (d) 350 + 450 + 550 + 650 + 750 + 850 + 950 To calculate 7 234 − 3 576 you can replace 7 000 + 200 + 30 + 4 by 6 000 + 1 100 + 120 + 14, or you can replace 7 234 by 235 + 6 999. You can use brackets to describe the second method: 7 234 − 3 576 = (235 + 6 999) − 3 576 = 235 + (6 999 − 3 576) = 235 + 3 423 = 3 658 8.

A good way to do this is to round off the numbers, and to calculate using the rounded-off numbers. For example, 7 258 − 3 574 can be approximated by rounding off to the nearest thousand: 7 000 − 4 000 = 3 000, so 7 258 − 3 574 is approximately 3 000. 7 258 − 3 574 can also be approximated by rounding off to the nearest hundred: 7 300 − 3 600 = 3 700, so 7 258 − 3 574 is approximately 3 700. The table below shows how rounding off to the nearest 100 is done. For example, all numbers between 150 and 249, including 150 and 249, are rounded off to 200.

Most mathematicians and scientists say, “Mathematics is the study of patterns.” The more patterns you can see in mathematics, the better you are at mathematics! So, this year, we continue studying patterns ... You will learn that in number sequences such as the one below, there is a pattern that does not change although the numbers change: there is a horizontal and a vertical calculation plan (rule) that is the same for all the input and output numbers: Input numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 ... Output numbers: 6 12 18 24 30 ... We can describe the patterns in such sequences in words, in a table, in a flow diagram and in a calculation plan. These help us to solve problems such as the following: 1. Write down the next five numbers in the sequence 6, 12, 18, 24, ... 2. Calculate the 100th number in the sequence 6, 12, 18, 24, ... 3.

We often know certain things about a situation, but then there may also be things that we do not know. Here are some examples. A. You may know that one can of juice costs R8 and that you need 23 cans. You may not know what the total cost of 23 cans is. B. You may know that there is 200 g of honey in a jar and that you will get only one eighth of it. You may not know how many grams of honey you will get. 1 8 of 200 is 1 4 of 100 which is . . . C. You may know that this house is 50 times bigger than the picture shows, and that the picture of the house is 4 cm high. You may want to know how high the actual house is. What you do to find the information you need in situations like the above, is called multiplication. Multiplication can be done in different ways, for example by repeated addition, by repeated doubling and by breaking down numbers into parts of which you already know the answers. Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 552016/12/15 1:13:22 PM 56 UNiT 5: WhoLe NUMberS: MULTiPLiCATioN AND DiViSioN Here and on the next page you can see four different ways to calculate the total cost of 23 cans of juice if each can costs R8. By repeated addition The total cost of 23 cans of juice at R8 each is 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8. To find the total you may add 8 repeatedly, 23 times: 8 + 8 → 16 + 8 → 24 + 8 → 32 + 8 → 40 . . . By building up from known or easy parts If you know some multiplication facts, for example that 10 × 8 = 80 and 3 × 8 = 24, you can work out 23 × 8 much more quickly. 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 10 × 8 10 × 8 3 × 8 Clearly, 23 × 8 = 10 × 8 + 10 × 8 + 3 × 8 = 80 + 80 + 24 = 18 4 1. Show how 23 × 8 can be calculated even more quickly if you know that 20 × 8 = 160. 2. (a) Suleiman buys 32 loaves of bread at R6 each. Work out how much this will cost in total. You can do it by adding 6 repeatedly, or by breaking the work down into easy parts. (b) Can the total cost of the loaves of bread be calculated by adding 32 repeatedly? Try it. Fortunately there are quicker and easier methods of multiplication. in this method, the 23 is actually broken down into 10 and 10 and 3, or into 20 and 3. That is why the method is sometimes called the breaking down and building up method. Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 562016/12/15 1:13:22 PM GrADe 5: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 57 Multiplication by repeated doubling 8 + 8 = 16, that is 2 × 8 16 + 16 = 32, that is 4 × 8 32 + 32 = 64, that is 8 × 8 64 + 64 = 128, that is 16 × 8 23 = 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 so 23 × 8 = 16 × 8 + 4 × 8 + 2 × 8 + 1 × 8 = 128 + 32 + 16 + 8 = 18 4 3. Do you think you can calculate 8 × 28 by doubling 28 repeatedly? Try it. Multiplication by rounding off and compensating To calculate 23 × 8 you may first round off the 23 to 20: 20 × 8 = 160 Of course this is not 23 × 8. We must change the 160 to undo the mistake we made by taking three eights too few. So 23 × 8 = 160 + 3 × 8 = 160 + 24 = 18 4 4. Calculate 28 × 8 by rounding off and compensating. 5. Calculate 32 × 29 in three different ways: (a) by doubling (b) by rounding off and compensating (c) by breaking down into known or easy parts To “double a number” means to add it to itself. For example, to double 26 you may add it to itself: 26 + 26 = 52 Changing an answer to undo a mistake is called compensation. in this case we compensate for the rounding off to 20 by adding 24 to 160.

For example, when you double 5, you get 10. When you double 10, you get 20. When you double 20, you get 40. When you double 50, you get 100. When you double 100, you get 200. 1. What do you get when you double 200? When you double 50 you get 100 which is 50 + 50. We can also say it is “two fifties” or 2 × 50. When you double again you get 200 which is 50 + 50 and another 50 + 50. So when you double 50 and double again, you get 200 which is 50 + 50 + 50 + 50. We can also say this is “four fifties” or 4 × 50. By doubling, we have found the multiplication fact 4 × 50 = 200.

So, the number 472 can be expressed as 6 × 78 + 4. Note that the number added to the product is smaller than both factors of 468. (4 is smaller than 78 and it is also smaller than 6.) Also note that one of the two factors of 468 is smaller than 10. (6 is smaller than 10.) 9. Now express 873 in the way 472 is expressed above. The one factor must be smaller than 10, and the number added must be smaller than the smaller of the two factors.

A. How many ribbons, each 4 cm long, can be cut from a roll of 824 cm ribbon tape? B. How long will each piece be if a roll of 824 cm ribbon tape is divided into 8 equal pieces? In both situations, 824 cm of ribbon tape is divided into equal parts. In Situation A, the size of each part is known, but the number of parts is not known. In Situation B, it is the other way round: the number of equal parts is known, but the size of the parts is not known. We use division for both these kinds of situations where a given quantity is made up of equal parts: A. to work out how many parts there are, if we know the size of the parts B. to work out how big each part is, if we know the number of parts. To do division, we may use our knowledge of multiplication facts. For example, 824 ÷ 4 can be worked out as follows: 200 × 4 = 800 and 6 × 4 = 24. So, 206 × 4 = 824 and this means that 824 ÷ 4 = 206. Division is called the inverse of multiplication. “To invert” means “to go the opposite way”. 1. How many classrooms can get 6 new chairs each, if 252 new chairs are available? 2.

To till their crops, knowledge of the seasons was important. It was only 5 000 to 6 000 years ago that the civilizations in the Middle East and Egypt found that they also needed ways to organise the time of day. A sundial An hourglass A Greek water clock In Egypt, at about 3 500 BC, the shadows of tall obelisks (tall pointed stone columns) moved like a kind of sundial dividing a day into “before noon” and “after noon”. These shadows also showed the shortest and the longest days of the year. The Egyptians also developed the sundial around 1 500 BC to show the passing of hours. This device could of course only be used during daytime when the sun was shining. Using a water clock was another way to measure time. The amount of water flowing out of or into a container at a steady pace was measured, and indicated the passing of time. Water clocks were used in Babylon (in modern-day Iraq) and Egypt around 1 600 BC. It is said that the Chinese used water clocks long before that. Even today we sometimes use an old instrument in our kitchens to measure time, for example when we boil an egg. This instrument, filled with fine sand, is called an hourglass.

Half of the Earth faces the Sun. This half has light. The other half faces away from the Sun and so this half has darkness. A day is divided into 24 hours. We start counting the hours from midnight. Even though we have 24 hours in one day most clocks show only 12 hours. The hour hand on this 12-hour clock moves around the clock twice in 24 hours. When your friend says he will phone at 7 o’clock, you need to know whether it is 7 o’clock in the morning or 7 o’clock in the evening. We write 7 a.m. for the morning. We write 7 p.m. for the evening. 1. Thembi travelled from Soweto to Port Elizabeth. She started her journey at 6 a.m. She arrived at 6 p.m. How many hours did she travel? 2.

Each hour was then divided into 60 shorter parts of equal length, called minutes. Each minute was divided into 60 shorter parts called seconds. We also talk about fractions of an hour, for example half an hour or a quarter of an hour. 1.

The analogue clock on the left measures 12-hour time around a circle. The digital clock on the right measures 24-hour time in numbers. Which clock do you find easier to read? People catching aeroplanes may get confused between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., so flight carriers use the 24-hour time notation. 8 p.m. is 20:00.

To make the calendar year a whole number of days, years do not all have the same number of days. Three normal years have 365 days each, and then every fourth year is called a leap year and has 366 days. The extra day is 29 February. 2012 was a leap year, so 2013, 2014 and 2015 were normal years. The calendar year is divided into 12 periods called months. The months do not all have the same number of d ays: some months have 31 days, some months have 30 days, and February has 28 or 29 days. A period of seven days is called a week, usually taken as starting on Sunday and ending on Saturday. 1. Find a calendar of this year. (a) Mark today’s date on the calendar.

At the conference you have to tell other people about recycling in your town. To be able to do this, you need information. Write down some questions about recycling in your town, for which you would like to have answers. Since 2011, the Department of Environmental Affairs has been gathering information from municipalities about how they manage the waste that people create. All this information becomes data about waste management and recycling. 2. (a) Write down what you think “waste” is. How do things become waste? (b) Where does the waste end up where you are living? What do you think will happen if South Africa’s towns and cities run out of landfill space? (c) Do you think data about waste in your town or village can be used to plan better? Explain why you say so. The table on the next page gives information about the waste that was produced by people living in the different provinces of South Africa in 2 0 11 . Municipal waste is the waste of households, restaurants and shops, but not the waste of factories or mines. An entrepreneur is someone who starts a new business. Waste is removed to landfill sites that are managed by the municipalities.

Read the information in the table. What does it tell you? Answer the questions: (a) Which provinces generate high amounts of waste per person? (b) Which provinces generate rather small amounts of waste per person? (c) Write down some reasons why you think the waste contribution per person in the different provinces varies so much. The waste per person is calculated as follows: The total mass of waste collected by all the municipalities in the province is calculated (added up). Then the total mass is divided by the number of people that live in the province. The kilogram waste per person in 2011 is the waste of the average person in 2011.

Copy and label the axes and the heading below, and then complete the graph using the data in the table on the previous page. Use the number line along the vertical axis to mark the numbers above each province. Then draw each bar from the bottom up to the correct height, in other words up to the marks that you have made. The number line where we can read the number of kilograms of waste per person is called the frequency axis. 2. Compare the amount of waste per person in 2011 in the Western Cape and in the Eastern Cape. (a) Use the table to work out how much more waste per person was collected in the Western Cape than in the Eastern Cape. (b) Use your bar graph to say how many times more the waste per person collected in the Western Cape was than the waste per person collected in the Eastern Cape. Kilograms of waste per person in 2011 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 Western Cape eastern Cape Northern Cape Free State KwaZulu-Natal North West Gauteng Mpumalanga Limpopo Provinces Number of kilograms Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 832016/12/15 1:13:29 PM 84 UNiT 7: DATA hANDLiNG 3. (a) Choose two other provinces to compare. Answer the same questions as in question 2 about the provinces you chose. (b) Work with a classmate. Think critically about the comparisons you made between the provinces. Make corrections if necessary. 4. The pie charts show different kinds of municipal waste collected in the Western Cape and Gauteng in 2011. (a) Estimate the fraction of organic waste in the Western Cape in 2011: Is it less than a quarter or more than a quarter of all the municipal waste in the Western Cape? (b) Estimate the fraction of municipal waste in the Western Cape in 2011 that could be recycled. (c) Estimate the fraction of municipal waste in Gauteng in 2011 that could not be recycled. (d) In which province was the recyclable waste one quarter of the municipal waste in 2011? (e) Use the pie charts to decide whether the following statement is true or false. Explain how you made your decision. If we would make compost of all the organic waste and would recycle all the waste that we can recycle, the landfill sites in the Western Cape and Gauteng would have received only about half the waste that they received in 2011. A key tells the meaning of the colours used in the pie chart.

Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 852016/12/15 1:13:30 PM 86 UNiT 7: DATA hANDLiNG How to make a pictograph Step 1: Draw a horizontal line and mark it off in equal lengths. Write the years in the correct order below the line. This is the category axis. Step 2: Decide on an icon (symbol) and on the number of people that your icon will represent. To do this, look at the size of your largest data value. You may choose a number such as 10, 20, or 30. You may also make an icon that represents half the number you chose; for example, if you decided your icon will represent 30, then half your icon will represent 15. Step 3: Round off the data values by counting in the number you chose. If you chose 30, count in 30s. As you count, write down the number closest to each data value. For example, if you count in 30s, then 150 is closest to 154. Calculate the number of icons you need to represent the data for each year. For example, if your icon represents 30 people, you will need 5 icons to represent 150 people. Step 4: Draw the icons neatly above each year. The icons must be arranged evenly so that you can see at a glance what the data tell. 7.3 Summarising and analysing data Mrs Mmako works at a buy-back centre. She has to keep track of how much waste they receive and sort. They need the information to plan how much money to have on the site to pay the waste collectors who bring in the recyclable waste, and how many waste sorters they need. They also need to know when to arrange for recycling companies to collect full truckloads of sorted waste. The buy-back centre is not open on Saturdays and Sundays, because they use those days to complete the sorting of the week’s waste. The table on the next page gives some of the buy-back centre’s data. Mrs Mmako says the data are of a typical week. if data are typical it means we can accept that they tell the story of what you can expect (more or less) when you look at any other week.

You must gather at least one week’s data. Step 1: Set up the project Label different containers for recyclable waste, organic waste and non-recyclable waste. Ask your Natural Sciences teacher to help you understand what kinds of waste should go where. Inform the other learners in the school (or your people at home) about your project and ask them to dispose of their waste in the correct bins. Step 2: Gather data Decide whether you want daily data or weekly data. Weigh the bags with waste at the same time of day, for example after the last period or after sports practice. Decide whether you want to gather data about specific kinds of recyclable waste. If so, sort the waste so that you can weigh the different kinds of waste (for example paper, glass, tins, and plastic) separately. Step 3: Represent and analyse the data Use your knowledge of data handling to draw pictographs or bar graphs of the data. Step 4: Interpret and report the data Write a report of your findings. Make recommendations to the school or to your family about working together to recycle waste. If you can, use the internet to find out about waste recycling projects in your area.

A plan needs to be made when there is not enough to subtract from, as in the above case. One plan is to think of 73 456 as 70 000 + 3 456 and to transfer 1 from the 70 000 to the 3 456. In this way 73 456 is replaced by 69 999 + 3 457. You can then subtract 26 879 from 69 999, and add the 3 457 back afterwards: 69 999 = 60 000 + 9 000 + 900 + 90 + 9 26 879 = 20 000 + 6 000 + 800 + 70 + 9 69 999 − 26 879 = 40 000 + 3 000 + 100 + 20 + 0 = 43 120 So, 73 456 − 26 879 = 43 120 + 3 457 which is 46 577. In this method you thus first change to an easier number to subtract from, then you add to the answer to compensate for the change you made. A different plan is to replace 70 000 + 3 000 + 400 + 50 + 6 by 60 000 + 12 000 + 1 300 + 140 + 16: 73 456 = 70 000 + 3 000 + 400 + 50 + 6 = 60 000 + 12 000 + 1 300 + 140 + 16 26 879 = 20 000 + 6 000 + 800 + 70 + 9 73 456 − 26 879 = 40 000 + 6 000 + 500 + 70 + 7 = 46 577 This is called the transfer method of subtraction.

If you round off to the nearest 100 cm, it is the same as rounding off to the nearest metre. Rounding off to the nearest 10 mm is the same as rounding off to the nearest centimetre, rounding off to the nearest 1 000 m is the same as rounding to the nearest kilometre and so on. So, 46 mm rounded off to the nearest centimetre is 5 cm. This is because there are 10 mm in 1 cm, and 46 mm is closer to 50 mm than to 40 mm. 2 592 m rounded to the nearest kilometre is 3 km. There are 1 000 m in 1 km, and 2 592 m is closer to 3 000 m than 2 000 m. We can also round off to other numbers, for example to the number 5.

B. 774 apples must be equally shared between 24 households. How many apples can each household get? You may know that 24 × 2 = 48 and 24 × 10 = 240. Using this, you can work out that 24 × 20 = 480, and that 24 × 30 = 24 × 10 + 24 × 20, and that is 240 + 480 which is 720. So 24 × 30 = 720. 1. Can you use the multiplication facts 24 × 2 = 48 and 24 × 30 = 720 to help you to find the answers to questions A and B above? Answer the questions now. To answer questions A and B you worked out what 24 must be multiplied by in order to get 774 or close to 774. This is the same as working out how many parts of 24 each there are in 774. We call this division and write this as 774 ÷ 24. Now think about questions C and D below. Do not work out the answers. C. 768 apples must be packed in boxes, with 27 apples in each box. How many boxes are needed? D. 768 apples must be equally shared between 27 households. How many apples should each household get? To answer questions C and D we have to work out how much 768 ÷ 27 is. This is the same as working out by what 27 must be multiplied to get 768 or close to it. Read the next page to see how we can find this out. Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 1892016/12/15 1:14:13 PM 190 UNiT 9: WhoLe NUMberS: DiViSioN A good way to start to develop an answer to this question is to ask yourself what multiplication facts about 27 you already know, or can easily make up. For example, you may know that 27 × 10 = 270. Half of that is 27 × 5 = 135. 27 × 20 is 270 doubled, so it is 540. We now use this knowledge to find out by what 27 must be multiplied to get 768: 27 × 20 = 540 and 27 × 5 = 135, so 27 × 25 = 540 + 135 which is 675. So 25 is not the answer yet. We need some more 27s. 675 + 27 → 702 + 27 → 729 + 27 → 75 6 So now we know that 27 × 25 + 27 × 3 = 756, which means that 27 × 28 = 756. 12 more is needed to get to 768. The shortfall of 12 is the remainder. This means that 27 must be multiplied by 28, and 12 must be added in order to get 768. We write this in symbols as 768 = 27 × 28 + 12. The answer can also be written like this: 768 ÷ 27 = 28 remainder 12. The mathematical statement 768 ÷ 27 = 28 remainder 12 tells us that 768 = 27 × 28 + 12. You do not have to write so much when you do division yourself! Just write what you really need to when you do questions 2 and 3. 2. Calculate 870 ÷ 33.

Everything we can touch has mass, even the tiniest thing. Sometimes our instruments cannot measure mass accurately enough and the scale may show a reading of zero. A reading of zero mass on one scale just means we need a better instrument to measure with. The standard unit of measurement for mass is the kilogram (kg). 1 ℓ of water has a mass of about 1 kg. Very light objects are measured in grams (g) or fractions of grams. 20 drops of water have a mass of 1 g. 1. Make your own 1 kg mass and 1 g mass. (a) Fill a clear plastic bag with 1 ℓ of water. (b) Fill another small plastic bag with 20 drops of water. If you ignore the mass of the plastic, you can use these bags to estimate the mass of other objects. 2. Make a balance scale to measure the mass of light objects. (a) Use your pencil, ruler and two identical pieces of cardboard or little boxes. Put the ruler over the pencil at the middle of the ruler. Put the cardboard pieces or boxes on the ruler on either side of the pencil. They must be the same distance away from the pencil. But even more important, the scale must balance, and one side must not dip down and the other dip up before you start using it.

Work with a classmate to combine your 1 g bags. (a) How many paper clips balance the mass of 1 g? (b) Estimate the mass of a paper clip. (c) Estimate the mass of a ballpoint pen. (d) Estimate the mass of an eraser. (e) Estimate the mass of a bottle top. (f) Find other objects that you think have a mass of about 1 g. Test your estimates using your balance scale. (g) Find objects that you think have a mass of about 5 g. Test your estimates using your balance scale. 2.2 Estimating and measuring mass A bathroom scale measures in kilograms. It is not accurate enough to measure differences in mass that are less than half a kilogram. A bathroom scale usually measures objects that vary between a mass of about 1 kg and 120 kg. Cooks and bakers use kitchen scales to measure small quantities in grams and kilograms. A kitchen scale usually weighs amounts from a few grams to between 2 and 5 kg. 1 kg is the same mass as 1 000 g. You can make more gram models. For example, fill another small plastic bag with 5 × 20 drops of water to make a model of about 5 g. Make one for 10 g also. remember to adjust your estimates, since the plastic bags also have mass!

(d) Is liquid soap heavier than water? (e) Is oil heavier than liquid soap? How could you test your ideas? Discuss this with the class. If we want to compare the mass of different things, we have to make sure we compare equal amounts of the things. if we work with estimates in measurements, our answers must always say “about so much”. We say that this is the approximate measurement. Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 2132016/12/15 1:14:25 PM 214 UNiT 1: CoMMoN FrACTioNS214 UNiT 2: MASS 6.

But if you are just interested in getting to the answer, you can combine the place value parts in your mind and write the answer directly as shown below. 6 524 = 6 000 + 500 + 20 + 4 3 245 = 3 000 + 200 + 40 + 5 6 524 + 3 245 = 9 769 4. Do these calculations by writing as in the example printed in colour above. (a) 7 435 + 3 532 (b) 43 364 + 34 523 When you are not explaining but just trying to find the answer, you can write even less if no transfers are needed. Look at this example for the calculation of 4 345 + 3 253: 4 345 + 3 253 7 598 Think of 4 345 as 4 000 + 300 + 40 + 5 but do not write it. Think of 3 253 as 3 000 + 200 + 50 + 3 but do not write it. Think of 5 + 3 = 8, 40 + 50 = 90, 300 + 200 = 500 and 4 000 + 3 000 = 7 000 and 7 000 + 500 + 90 + 8, but only write 7 598. When you write like this to do addition, we say you add in columns. 5. Think and write like in the above example to calculate the following: (a) 5 436 + 3 352 (b) 23 572 + 53 215 (c) 35 254 + 42 623 (d) 23 234 + 32 123 + 11 442 Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 2242016/12/15 1:14:27 PM GrADe 5: MATheMATiCS [TerM 3] 225 6.

You can calculate 8 + 6 = 14 and write the 14. If you now calculate 50 + 30 = 80, you will find that the “1” of the 14 sits in the place where you want to write the “8” of the 80. 3 658 + 5 736 14 ??? 80 Fortunately there is a simple solution for this problem. You can write the 80 in the next line, and continue to write the total for each kind of place value part in a new line, as shown in red below. It is now easy to form the answer from the part answers for the different kinds of place value parts. The reasons for the part answers are shown in blue. 3 658 + 5 736 14 80 1 300 8 000 9 394 . . .

When you add 6 to 7 you can write the 13 in two parts as shown on the right. By doing this, the space under the 90 and 50 is left open. When 50 + 90 = 140 is calculated in the next step, the 140 can also be written in two parts as shown on the right. This leaves the space to the left of the “4” open for the next step, when 600 + 900 is calculated.

(a) 7 688 + 8 567 (b) 45 847 + 37 586 (c) 38 586 + 26 795 Instead of adding only the 90 and 50 in the second step of the calculation shown in the above example, you can calculate 90 + 50 + 10 = 150, and write it as shown on the right. We say you “carry” the 10 from the 7 + 6 = 13 to the 90 + 50 = 140, to make it 150. You can also say you transfer the 10. Similarly, you can transfer (carry) the 100 of 150 to 600 + 900 in the next step. You then have 600 + 900 + 100 and the written work will look like this. In the next step you carry 1 000. On the right you can see what you will have written when you have finished.

One way to get around this difficulty is to replace 63 543 by 3 543 + 60 000 and then by 3 544 + 59 999. You can then calculate 59 999 − 27 688 and add 3 544. This is called the change-and-compensate method.

We are comfortable when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. When we say “it is cold today”, it is because our bodies are warmer than the environment. When we complain that it is too hot, it is because our bodies are colder than the environment. When water gets very cold, it freezes to become ice. When water gets very hot, it boils. 1. Rub the palm of your one hand with a finger from your other hand. Rub hard until you feel your skin burn slightly. The rubbing makes your skin warmer. 2. Take a book from your bag. Is it colder or warmer than your hand? 3. When does ice melt faster outside, on a warm day or on a cold day? 4. When does boiled water cool down faster, on a warm day or on a cool day? In South Africa we usually measure temperature in units called degrees Celsius (we write °C). Water boils when its temperature is close to 100 °C. When you are healthy, your body temperature is about 37 °C. The temperature in a home refrigerator is about 5 °C. Water freezes when its temperature is about 0 °C. Except when it gets colder than when water freezes, the temperature of the environment varies between 0 °C and 50 °C. The environmental temperature is pleasant when it is between 20 °C and 30 °C. We use a thermometer to measure temperature accurately. There are many different thermometers. One type of thermometer consists of a sealed glass tube that contains a liquid, such as mercury, that rises (expands) or falls (contracts) with temperature changes. “Thermo” means heat. Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 2522016/12/15 1:14:31 PM GrADe 5: MATheMATiCS [TerM 3] 253 Each thermometer has a scale which is marked in equal intervals, from the lowest temperature to the highest temperature that it can measure. This is an example of a medical thermometer This thermometer shows a temperature of 37 °C. If a patient has a temperature of, for example, 37 1 2 °C we can round off the temperature to the nearest degree and then say that the patient has a temperature of about 38 °C. 5.

She pays her account every month and she is very careful to save electricity. Why is it so high this month? This month, July, her account is R650. She believes that she used her usual amount of electricity. And there was lots of load shedding, so her account should be less than usual, not more than usual! We will analyse Mrs Mholo’s accounts over the past 12 months to see if there is a pattern in her use of electricity. Here are Mrs Mholo’s accounts, in rands, for the past 12 months, ordered by the months.

You check every toss to see if it is “heads” or “tails”. (a) Write down what you think the results will be when you toss a coin 20 times. (b) How many “heads” do you think you will get if you toss the coin many, many times? (c) How many “tails” do you think you will get if you toss the coin many, many times? Explain why you say so. 2. Work with a classmate to do the coin- tossing experiment. Record your results in a tally table. Each of you must toss the coin 20 times. At the end you should have the result of your 20 tosses, and your classmate should have the result of his or her 20 tosses. TalliesFrequency Heads Tails (a) What fraction of your 20 results is “heads” ( ? 20 )? Did your experiment work out the way you thought it would? Explain why you say so. (b) What fraction of your classmate’s 20 results is “heads” ( ? 20 )? Do you think there is a problem with the experiment if your results are very different? Explain why you say so. A coin has two sides. The “tail” side of a coin is the side that says what the coin is worth. The “head” side is the side with the country’s coat of arms. A coin toss has two outcomes, either “heads” or “tails”. Frequency means how often a certain outcome has occurred; in this case, how many times you got “heads” and how many times you got ”tails”.

(b) What fraction of the results is “tails”? (c) Are you surprised by the results? Explain why you say so. 11.2 Spinner Experiment 1 Make your own spinner Look at the picture. Take a square piece of cardboard and make a hole in the centre. Put your pencil through the hole. Then make a dot or mark at the centre of each of the sides of the square. Make sure you have paper to record your results in tally tables and to draw graphs. Practise spinning your spinner properly at a fast speed. When the spinner stops and topples over, the dot on the side on which the spinner comes to rest gives the position of the spinner. Fold a clean page in half, and crosswise in half again. Open up the page. It now has four parts of equal size. Mark the central point, that is, the point where the folds intersect. Colour two of the four parts red (or just write RED in them). Colour the other two parts blue (or just write BLUE in them). Put your spinner on the central point of the page and spin it properly. Note whether the dot lands on a blue or a red part of the page. Spin the spinner 20 times. Each time write down the result of the spin (outcome) in a tally table. Maths_English_LB_Grade5_Book.indb 3472016/12/15 1:15:05 PM 348 UNiT 11: ProbAbiLiTY 1. Think about Spinner Experiment 1. (a) Do you think the results could be influenced by where you place the spinner when you start to spin? (b) Do you think your experiment could be influenced by how slow or fast you spin the spinner? (c) Will it matter if the parts are coloured in such a way that the two red parts (areas) are next to each other and the two blue parts are next to each other? Why do you say so? (d) What are the possible outcomes of Spinner Experiment 1? 2. Compare your data (that is, the results of Spinner Experiment 1) with that of other classmates. What fraction of the 20 spins in their experiments was RED? 3. Work with the rest of the class. Use the information in your tally tables to make a pictograph to show how many REDS each classmate got out of 20 spins. (a) Draw a number line in your book that runs from 0 to 20. Nobody will be able to get more than 20 REDS in 20 spins. (b) As each learner says how many REDS he or she got, make a cross above that number. (c) Write a short paragraph about the story of the graph. Sometimes people think the number of RED results and the number of BLUE results must be the same in any experiment, because the page is divided into two equal parts. This is not true. Only when we do an experiment with many, many spins can we expect to see almost the same number of RED and BLUE results if the page is divided into two equal parts. We cannot expect that in small experiments.

Your page now has four parts of equal size. Open the page up and mark the point where the folds intersect. Colour three of the four parts red (or just write RED in them). Colour the remaining part blue (or just write BLUE in it). 1. Before you start, first think about the experiment. (a) What are the possible outcomes of Spinner Experiment 2? (b) Do you think the results will be similar to your results for Spinner Experiment 1? Why do you say so? 2. Now do Spinner Experiment 2. Put your spinner at the centre of the page and spin it properly. Note whether the dot lands on a blue or a red part of the page. Spin the spinner 20 times. Each time record the result of the spin in a tally table. (a) Combine your data with the data of four classmates so that you have 100 results. (b) What fraction of the 100 results was RED? What fraction was BLUE?

Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hi there! My name is Mothusi. My favourite subjects at school are where I get to be creative and imaginative. But, did you know, this is not only in the art or drama classroom? We can also be creative in the ways we do Science and Technology. This is especially true when thinking about new ways to answer a question with a Science investigation or drawing a design to solve a problem. I also really love being outdoors in the natural world around me. This is why I am going to go through Life and Living with you. I think we are very lucky to live in such a beautiful place as South Africa, with so many colours and plants and animals. I am really excited to start learning more about the living world around us. Felicity is my best friend and she teaches me how to think carefully and solve problems using logic, which is a very good skill to have in Science. Although we can get on each other’s nerves, just like best friends do, we have so much fun together and learn a lot from each other. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 62018/05/18 10:31:38 AM Hello!

The first is in the Science lab because this is where we get to be inventive and tinker away with projects and experiments! My second favourite place is the kitchen! Do you know how many interesting substances you can find there? I use these substances in my experiments. This is why I am really excited to be going through Matter and Materials and Processing with you. We are going to learn about all sorts of materials around us. Especially about metals and processing materials and non-metals. I also really enjoy Maths and thinking about how we can solve problems logically.

I just want to dive straight into this year, and especially Natural Sciences and Technology. Sometimes though, I find it hard to sit still in class as I just want to get up and do things! My teacher often says I have too much energy and I battle to sit still in class. Maybe that’s why I am going through Energy and Change with you this year. I am really looking forward to understanding what fossil fuels and electricity really are! And, we also get to make a wagon this year. The best part about Natural Sciences and Technology is that we get to learn actively. We have goals and questions that we want to answer and I am always the first to leap into action! Walt and I make a very good team because he is very good at thinking and planning, and then following a method. But I think I can also help as sometimes Walt wants to think too much, whereas in Science and Technology you also have to get involved in the subject and start experimenting. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 82018/05/18 10:31:41 AM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hello! My name is Felicity. One of my favourite places to be is in the school library. I love reading a new book – there is just so much to learn and discover about our world! I am always asking questions. Often these questions do not yet have answers to them! This is fascinating as we then get to make a theory about what we think the answer might be. This is why I really enjoy learning about outer space as there is so much that we do not know. Throughout history people have been asking questions about the structure of our planet. This is why I am going to go through Earth and Beyond with you as we learn more about our planet Earth and the fossils found on it. I also like expressing my opinion and debating about a topic. You have to give me a very good argument to convince me of your opinion! I love exploring with Mothusi as she helps me to be more creative and imaginative in the way that I think. I can also be quite sceptical and do not believe everything I read. But, this is very important in Science as we must not always accept everything as fact.

Are there animals and plants down there? • Where is the highest mountain on earth? Do plants and animals live up there? • Do you get living things in the desert? • What are vertebrates and invertebrates? You might have heard that people say our planet Earth is the Blue Planet. If astronauts in space look down on Earth, the water that covers more than two thirds of the planet makes it look as if the planet is blue. Thousands of plants and animals can live on Earth because there is water. The many plants and animals that live on Earth choose special places to live. The place where a plant or animal lives is called its habitat. There is a special word we use to talk about all the animals and plants in their different habitats. This word is biodiversity. When you study the biodiversity of a specific area, you look at all the different kinds of habitats in that area, including its animals and plants. QUESTIONS Discuss this in class: Why is it important to study the biodiversity of our planet? Then write down some of the main points from your class discussion. Did you know? Plants and animals need water to live. Scientists search for water on other planets because they hope that if they find water they might find life forms there as well! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 42018/05/18 10:31:43 AM 5Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth5 1.1 Many different plants and animals The Earth is home to the most amazing diversity of animals and plants. Each animal and plant naturally chooses where it wants to live, its habitat. We can identify different types of habitats on earth: • Aquatic (water) • Desert • Grassland • Forest Within each habitat there are animals and plants that have adapted to live specifically in that environment. Let’s take a look at some of the most common plants and animals that live in each of these habitats. Water habitat Many thousands of different animals and plants live in or near water in aquatic habitats. There are two main kinds of aquatic habitats – salty, marine habitats and freshwater habitats. The plants and animals that live in these habitats are adapted to either live in salt water or in fresh water. In South Africa there are examples of both kinds of aquatic habitats. Our country has a long coastline with different habitats, where a variety of animals and plants live. Many animals live in and around the rock pools. They can withstand the harsh sun and the constant pounding of the waves. Seagulls resting on the shore. Starfish are found in rock pools along the coast. New words • biodiversity • aquatic • breeding ground • estuary • extinct • succulents Did you know? “Aqua” means “water” in Latin. A word with “aqua-” normally has something to do with water, like aquatic or aquarium. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 52018/05/18 10:31:44 AM Life and living6 A rocky coastline with rock pools. Our seas are also filled with animals of all shapes and sizes. Large mammals like whales and dolphins swim in our seas. Dolphins playing in the waves. 1 A southern right whale with her calf off the coast of Hermanus, a popular breeding ground for whales in September. 2 The sea is also home to many schools of fish. The coral reefs off the South African coast, especially on the east coast such as Sodwana Bay, are very rich in fish and animal species. Where a river runs into the sea a special area called an estuary develops. The fresh water from the river mixes with the salty sea water. You can often find mudskippers here – fish that can hop onto land and into trees! Did you know? South Africa is the only place on Earth where the great white sharks have learnt to jump out of the water when they catch seals (off Seal Island in False Bay). Did you know? Female dolphins are called cows, males are called bulls and young dolphins are called calves. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 62018/05/18 10:31:44 AM 7Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth7 Mudskippers live in estuaries, but they can hop onto land and into low branches. 3 ACTIVITY 1.1: Identifying marine animals and plants INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Carefully study the photos of different marine animals and plants off South Africa’s coast. 2. Then answer the questions about these pictures. Crab 4 School of fish 5 A crayfish in the shallow water. 6 A penguin diving down under the water. 7 Did you know? The waters off South Africa’s coast is home to a rare fish – the coelacanth! Scientists thought this prehistoric fish was extinct until they found living coelacanths in South Africa’s waters.

Can you imagine how difficult it must be to live on rocks being pounded by waves all day and all night long? Which animals in these photos live on or near the rocks? 2. Describe at least three different ways that animals protect themselves against the pounding waves. 3. Carefully study all the animals in the picture and find things that some animals have in common. Classify the animals into groups based on these similarities. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 82018/05/18 10:31:45 AM 9Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth9 4. Many eco-tourists like to visit our country and see the sights. Some tourists like to go on tours where they go into a cage that is lowered into the sea. The tour operators often chuck small pieces of meat into the water to attract sharks, which then swim around the cage. Do you think shark cage diving is appropriate? Explain why you think so. Let’s now look at the plants and animals that live in freshwater, such as dams, ponds, streams and rivers. Many animals live in or near freshwater ponds, dams and lakes, or rivers and streams. Small insects, snails, clams, crabs, frogs and fish live in or near water. Larger animals like turtles, snakes, ducks and large fish, as well as hippos and crocodiles also live in or near water. Ducks raise their chicks near Hippopotamus’ live near to plants where there is lots of and in freshwater. food for their young in between the reeds and water plants. Can you see how this frog is A crocodile lies by the side resting on the lily pad? of a river. Did you know? Sharks have amazing hearing. They can hear a fish moving in the water from as far as 500 metres away! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 92018/05/18 10:31:45 AM Life and living10 Some water plants have roots, for example water lilies and reeds. Water plants make oxygen for the animals to breathe and provide food for many of the animals. Water lilies floating on the water. 14 In South Africa we also have large wetlands where rivers slow down and the water stands still or flows very slowly. Wetlands provide food and shelter as a natural habitat for an incredible amount of animals: frogs, reptiles, birds (like ducks and waders) and fish are only a few of these! ACTIVITY 1.2: Studying an aquatic habitat MATERIALS: • Pencil • Paper • Clipboard • Sunblock and a hat INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in groups and visit an aquatic habitat near your school. A stream or river, pond or dam, or perhaps a rockpool if you are near the sea. 2. Find examples of three different animals and three different plants that live in that environment. 3. Carefully study where they live and how you think the animals and plants are suited to their habitat. For example, answer these questions: a. Are the stems of the plants rigid or flexible? b. Do the plants grow inside the water or just outside? Did you know? Waterblommetjie bredie is made from water lilies. Have you ever eaten it? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 102018/05/18 10:31:45 AM 11Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth11 c. What do the animals eat? d. How do the animals breathe? 4. If possible, take some pictures of the plants and animals you observe. Or draw a diagram. 5. Report this information back to your class. Deserts and semi-desert habitat Deserts are areas that have a very low rainfall each year – in some deserts it only rains once every ten years! The Namibian desert The deserts may look dry, but there are many different plants and animals that are suited to living in these areas. Plants that can survive without much water in the desert are grasses, acacias, aloes, cactii and other succulents. Succulents are plants that can store their water in their leaves and stems, and survive well in dry climates. Can you see the thick leaves for storing water in this succulent plant? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 112018/05/18 10:31:46 AM Life and living12 Many animals live in deserts, such as the Kalahari. Some of these animals are: • Predators such as lions, cheetahs and leopards, as well as hyenas and jackals. • Large and small mammals, such as meerkats, giraffes, warthogs and porcupines. • Antelope like eland, gemsbok, springbok, hartebeest, steenbok, kudu and duiker. • Many species of birds including falcons, ravens, eagles, buzzards, hawks and turtle doves. The social weavers are small weaver birds that build family nests where hundreds of weaver families can live! • Many different reptiles like puffadders, cobras, lizards, geckos and iguanas. • A great many insects also live in the desert, such as bees and butterflies, grasshoppers and many more!

Grassland habitat Grasslands are covered in grasses and have very few trees. As soon as the first rains fall the grasses grow incredibly fast and new plants sprout all over the black earth. This is also the time when many animal babies are born as the new grass feeds the mothers to provide plenty of milk for the young. QUESTIONS List some of the animals that you think live in grasslands in your exercise books. Forest habitat A forest is a large area that is mostly covered in trees. Forests are extremely important for life on earth. The many trees clean the air and provide oxygen for the animals on earth to breathe. They also provide people with fuel, food, shelter, medicine and employment. Many animals live in forests, from large elephants and bears to smaller monkeys, squirrels, owls and woodpeckers. We need to conserve (look after) our forests and stop people who want to chop down naturally growing trees. It is very important though to also conserve the many animals that pollinate trees and spread their seeds over large areas. Without these animals the trees would not be able to reproduce and will become extinct.

I never realised South Africa has so many plants and animals. We have a really diverse country! ACTIVITY 1.3: Counting plants and animals MATERIALS: • Something to mark out an area (such as stones or sticks to make the corners, and string to tie in between) • Scrap paper • Pencils and coloured pencils or crayons • Clipboard • Sunblock and hat • Measuring tape or ruler INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs and take a walk with your class to a park or nature area outside your school. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 142018/05/18 10:31:46 AM 15Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth15 2. Choose an area where you would like to work. Carefully mark out a section of your area with the sticks and string. 3. Study the animals and plants in that area. Make a drawing of the habitat showing all the plants and animals that you see there. Use scrap paper for this. 4. Do you know the names of these plants and animals? Perhaps an adult can help you name the animals or plants you don’t know. Write the names of each animal and plant as labels. 5. Make sure that you have at least five examples of different plants and animals. 6. Measure the heights of the plants and record them in a table. 7. Collect leaves from two of the plants and make leaf rubbings as you did in Grade 4. 8. If there are any flowers or seeds, gently collect some and take them back to class. Your teacher will show you how to press them. 9. When you return to class make a neat copy of your drawing in your book. 10. In your exercise books, write a heading: Plants and animals we found in our habitat area. 1.2 Interdependence in an ecosystem Plants and animals, humans, rivers, mountains – everything is connected in one way or another. All the living and non-living things depend on each other. QUESTIONS Do you think you are connected to or interdependent with plants and rivers? Discuss this with your class and write the answers in your exercise books. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 152018/05/18 10:31:46 AM Life and living16 We can group interdependence into two main groups: 1. The interdependence in an ecosystem between living things: when we talk about how animals and plants are interdependent. 2. The interdependence in an ecosystem between living and non-living things. Interdependence between living things Many plants and animals depend on each other for different things. Let’s have a look at some of these. Interdependence and feeding Animals depend on plants and each other for food. We get the following groups of animals: • Herbivores eat plants. • Carnivores eat the animals that eat the plants. • Omnivores eat plants and animals. • Scavengers feed off dead animals and plants. • Decomposers eat and break up the dead animals and put the chemicals from their bodies (carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen) back into the soil to feed the plants. Interdependence and pollination Plants also depend on animals for pollination. This is when the pollen of one flower travels to another to fertilise it. We call animals that pollinate flowers pollinators. Plants produce something that attracts pollinators. This is often nectar, a special smell or a brightly coloured flower, but it can also be a safe place to lay their eggs. Some plants even make their flowers look like female wasps to attract male wasps! New words • ecosystem • herbivores • carnivores • omnivores • scavengers • decomposers • pollination • nectar • seed dispersal Did you know? Sometimes farmers don’t have enough bees on their farms to pollinate their crops. They rent hives from travelling bee hive managers who bring their hives to pollinate the farmer’s crops. Bees about to collect nectar and, at the same time, pollinate the flowers. 16 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 162018/05/18 10:31:47 AM 17Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth17 Plants and animals depend on each other. Many flowering plants depend on bees to pollinate them. Bees depend on the nectar inside the flowers to make their honey. Without the nectar they cannot make honey, and without the pollen the flowers cannot fertilise their seeds – and will not be able to reproduce or live eventually. QUESTIONS Bees are not the only animals that can pollinate flowering plants. What animals do you think can pollinate a tree’s flowers? Look at the pictures: Bird feeding off the nectar A wasp feeding off the nectar and pollinating the flower. 17 and pollinating the flowers. 18 A beetle feeding off a flower. As it moves around the flower, it also pollinates the flower. 19 A world without pollinators would be very ‘unsweet’. Look at the following things that we eat and drink, which all depend on pollinators. Did you know? A third of everything we eat is there thanks to pollinators! We really depend on pollinators for our food!

If all the seeds fall in one spot, the plants that grow will not have enough water, soil or light to grow properly! Plants therefore make their fruit sweet and tasty. In this way they attract animals who will eat the fruit, walk a long way off and excrete the seeds. Where the seeds fall they will then have a rich, fertile soil (from the animal excretion) to grow in! Other seeds stick to an animal’s fur – they might not even know it’s there! When they brush against a tree for example, the seed will just fall off. The plants depend on animals for seed dispersal.

INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Read the story about the honey badger and the honeyguide below. 2. Answer the questions that follow. The honey badger loves to eat honey! The honeyguide bird loves to eat bee larvae but cannot get into the beehive without being stung to death. The bird also cannot break the hive open. So when the honeyguide finds a beehive, it goes in search of a honey badger. The honey badger has a thick skin that bee stings do not easily get through. The honeyguide then convinces the honey badger to follow it to the bee hive. The honey badger is able to use its strong legs, claws and teeth to break open the hive, and its thick coat protects it from being stung. After the badger has finished eating the delicious golden honey, the honeyguide can enjoy all the bee larvae! QUESTIONS: 1. Why can’t the honeyguide bird just eat some of the larvae without waiting for the honey badger? 2. How does the honey badger break open the hive? 3. Why does the honey badger not get stung by the bees? 4. Explain in your own words how this is an example of interdependence between three animals. Visit The honey badger and honeyguide (video). goo.gl/G1OqG NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 192018/05/18 10:31:48 AM Life and living20 Interdependence between living and non-living things The living things are also dependent on the non-living things in an ecosystem. Living things depend on their environment for: • Air (oxygen and carbon dioxide) • Water • Soil • Food • Shelter and a place to safely have their young. • Places to hide from danger. Water and oxygen are extremely important for all living things. QUESTIONS Have you ever wondered how the water ‘gets’ into the clouds if it runs in rivers and streams? Remember you did the water cycle in Gr 4. Water that we drink from a tap or from a river, is all part of a gigantic system called the Water Cycle. The Water Cycle shows that we are all interdependent. ACTIVITY 1.5: The Water cycle INSTRUCTIONS: 1. The image on page 21 of the water cycle shows all the processes that take place. 2. Revise these processes with your partner. 3. Write a paragraph to explain the water cycle. QUESTION: 1. You can change the water vapour you breathe out into water drops again! Find a mirror or window. Breathe on it. What do you see on the window? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 202018/05/18 10:31:48 AM 21Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth21 Freezing Melting Run off Evaporation Evaporation Precipitation (rain) The water cycle Trees and other plants depend on the water in the soil. Other animals and plants depend on the water that runs down from the mountains in rivers and streams, and collects in lakes. Plants and animals in the sea depend on this water as it forms their whole environment that they live in. ACTIVITY 1.6: Describing interdependence INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in groups and carefully study the animals on page 22. 2. See if you can identify the interdependence between the animals and/or plants, and the non-living things in their environment. 3. Discuss the interdependence with your group and make some notes on scrap paper. 4. Descriptions of each photo have been provided. You need to match the photo with the description by writing the correct letter next to each picture in your exercise books. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 212018/05/18 10:31:48 AM Life and living22 PictureAnswerDescription of interdependence A: Clownfish and anemones. Clownfish do not get hurt by the poison from the anemone. The clownfish feed on small creatures living in the anemone that may harm the anemone, and in turn the fish’s waste nourishes the anemone. The anemone’s poisonous stings protect the clownfish from predators. B: Earthworms in the soil. The earthworms are dependent on the soil for a place to live. They need rich, moist soil otherwise they will dry out if they are exposed to the dry air for too long. As earthworms dig through the soil they also excrete droppings back into the soil, which makes it more fertile for other plants and animals. As the earthworms dig, they also help to aerate the soil by creating tunnels. C: Weaver building its nest. Many birds rely on trees and plants to build their nests to raise their young. The weaver uses green reeds to build its nest. When the reeds are still green they are flexible and can bend. When they dry out they become harder and make a more stable, stronger nest. D: Rhino and oxpecker. The oxpecker picks ticks off the rhino as its food and frees the rhino from these pests. They also live on zebra, giraffe, buffalo, etc. E: Anatolian shepherd dogs and the herd of sheep they protect from cheetahs. Anatolian puppies are placed with a herd of sheep and they become attached to the sheep. When a predator (like a cheetah) comes near the flock the dog will chase them off. If the dogs are protecting a herd, the cheetahs are also protected because farmers will not kill them. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 222018/05/18 10:31:48 AM 23Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth23 QUESTIONS: 1. Which interdependent relationship is between an animal and a plant? 2. Which interdependent relationship described is between an animal and the non-living things in its environment? 3. Which example in the photos involves the inter- dependence between three animals, and what are they? 1.3 Animal types We now know about some of the different habitats on Earth and in South Africa, and we know that animals and plants depend on each other and on their habitat. Let’s look at the different types of animals that live on Planet Earth. Grouping animals When we group similar things together, we call this classifying. When classifying animals, there are really two main groups of animals – those who have bones inside their bodies with a backbone, and those who do not have bones inside their bodies. • Animals with a backbone are classified as vertebrates. • Animals without a backbone are classified as invertebrates. ACTIVITY 1.7: Classifying animals INSTRUCTIONS: 1. A radiographer takes x-rays of people and animal’s bones. Tracey the radiographer took some interesting x-rays of five animals. Carefully look at these x-rays on page 24 and decide which animals are vertebrates. In your exercise books, write down the names of animals that are vertebrates. New words • exoskeleton • endoskeleton • hydroskeleton • molluscs • segmented • thorax • abdomen Visit Website about the Cheetah conservation project. goo.gl/Roayb NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 232018/05/18 10:31:48 AM Life and living24 Different vertebrates and invertebrates 2. Why can you not see bones inside the crab or grasshopper’s bodies? 3. What do we call animals like the grasshopper and the crab? 4. Study the animals from Activity 1.6 on interdependence. Decide if they are vertebrates with bones inside their bodies, or invertebrates without bones inside their bodies. 5. Copy the table below in your exercise books and write the name of each animal in the correct column. Vertebrates with bonesInvertebrates without bones When people saw that they could group the animals into two main groups, they started grouping them into smaller groups within these two main groups. Look at this next illustration, which shows some of these groups.

Look again at the illustration of all the different groups. 2. Why do you think the animals were put into a left group and a right group? 3. Vertebrates are divided into five groups. What are these groups? 4. One of the birds in the illustration is South Africa’s national bird, which one is it? 5. Give two examples of an arthropod. Let’s now have a closer look at invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates Invertebrates are animals that do not have an endoskeleton or a bony skeleton inside their bodies. Some have a hydroskeleton and some others have an exoskeleton. QUESTIONS Look at the illustration of all the classes of animals on page 25 again. Can you find other examples of animals with no bones inside their bodies (endoskeleton) and with no hard outer skeleton (exoskeleton)? Write the answers in your exercise books. These soft-bodied animals mostly have what we call a hydroskeleton. Examples of animals with a hydroskeleton are: • sea anemones • earthworms • jellyfish • some starfish and sea urchins Did you know? If ‘hydro’ is in a word that word generally has something to do with water! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 262018/05/18 10:31:49 AM 27Chapter 1: Plants and animals on Earth27 Animals with such a body often need to live in or near water or damp soil. Their skins are often thin and moist because they breathe through their skin. An earthworm needs to live A jellyfish has a in damp soil. 24 hydroskeleton. 25 Invertebrates that have a tough hard covering over their soft bodies have an exoskeleton or an external skeleton. QUESTIONS Can you think of any invertebrates that have exoskeletons? Write your answer in your exercise books. Have a look at the illustration on page 25 again if you need some ideas. Many invertebrates have a shell covering their bodies to protect them. Underneath a starfish. Sea shells protect the soft Can you see the little “legs” bodies of invertebrates. 27 sticking out of the exoskeleton? 26 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 272018/05/18 10:31:49 AM Life and living28 Have you ever walked along the beach and picked up shells? I love picking up shells to make things, such as mobiles and necklaces! A hermit crab hiding safely The hermit crab now decides in a hard shell. 28 it is safe to walk around. 29 Insects are in an interesting group of invertebrates: • All insects have exoskeletons. • They all have segmented bodies and legs. That means their bodies and legs are made up of different sections. • Insects have six legs and three main body parts – a head, chest (thorax) and a tail (abdomen). Did you know? Hermit crabs have very soft bodies, not like their other crab and crayfish family. The hermit crab finds an empty shell and settles down inside. When the crab grows too big for the shell, it moves out and finds a bigger shell! Did you know? 97% of animals alive today are invertebrates! (That means almost all animals are invertebrates!)

Every time a vertebrate animal moves, it uses its bones, joints and muscles to do this. In this section we are going to study the bones, joints and muscles that help vertebrates to move. Bones Bones are hard and form a very strong frame structure to support and protect a vertebrate animal’s body. All vertebrates have similar kinds of bones – some are much bigger than others, but the basic structure of the bones are very similar.

How many functions of the bones in the skeleton can you remember? 2. Your teacher will hand out a jumbled puzzle of the human skeleton. Carefully cut out each piece along the dotted line. 3. Build your human skeleton on the back of your recycled cardboard – do not stick it on yet as you might need to move it slightly if it does not fit properly onto the cardboard. 4. When you have it in place correctly, use glue to stick it to the cardboard. 5. Cut out the labels from the table. 6. Carefully pack the labels in the correct places. Do not stick these down until you have done all of them, as you might need to reposition them to fit it all in. Here are the words of a very old song that teaches you about bones. The chorus lines have been left out each time. 1. Work in groups and compose a rap rhythm and beat. 2. Compose your own tune or use an existing song to accompany these lyrics. Feel free to make or use instruments to accompany your singing. 3. Present your song to the class. Did you know? An adult has an average of 206 bones in their body!

Which of the animals is a mammal? 2. Which is an amphibian? Functions of the bones in a vertebrate skeleton Now that you know how to identify the different kinds of bones in vertebrates, let’s take a closer look at the functions of some of these bones. The skull Vertebrate skulls are made up of different bones that grow together to form a protective ‘box’ or ‘shell’ structure. • The skull protects the eyes and ears, nose and mouth. • It protects the brain. • Vertebrates’ teeth and lower jaw is also attached to the skull. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 392018/05/18 10:31:52 AM Life and living40 QUESTIONS Can you identify the animals that each of these skulls belong to? Write the names in your exercise books. The backbone Rear view Side view The human backbone and vertebrae Did you know? A baby and an adult do not have the same amount of bones. When a baby is born, their skull bones are not joined. The bones can move over each other to allow the baby to go through the birth canal! After birth the skull bones start to grow together! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 402018/05/18 10:31:52 AM 41Chapter 2: Animal skeletons41 • The backbone is made up of vertebrae. • A hole runs through the middle of each vertebrae. The holes all light up to form a tube that the spinal cord lies in. • The backbone has two functions (jobs): – It protects the spinal cord with all the nerves and vessels in it. – It supports the upper part of the body. QUESTIONS Compare the bones in the backbone of the giraffe below with that of the human above. What do you notice about the shape of the vertebrae in the neck and in the back of the giraffe and those of the human’s neck and bones? Giraffe skeleton The ribs Vertebrates have long curved bones that we call ribs. These ribs are joined to the backbone and often to the front to form the rib cage. Did you know? Giraffe only have seven vertebrae in their necks – go ahead and count them! That is exactly the same as in a human neck – and almost all other mammals. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 412018/05/18 10:31:53 AM Life and living42 • In most vertebrates the ribcage is around the chest area of the animal to protect the lungs, heart and other important organs. • In animals like snakes, the ribcage can protect and support the whole body. • The breast bone in birds is much longer. The flight muscles attach to this. This is a human rib cage. Many mammals have a similar shape rib cage. Compare the rib cages of these animals to your own. An elephant skeleton – A snake’s rib cage protects do you see the rib cage and supports almost the and backbone? whole body. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 422018/05/18 10:31:53 AM 43Chapter 2: Animal skeletons43 Do you see the front limbs of a dolphin look just like the limbs of other mammals? Shoulder blades, arms, legs and hip bones Vertebrates use their fore and back limbs for movement. Many animals’ limbs are attached to their bodies at the shoulder or hip joints. However not all animals have hip or shoulder girdles – like fish and snakes. • Muscles attach to the shoulder blades and they control the movement of the forelimb or arm. • The lower or back limbs (legs) attach to the body at the hips. The human arm. Can you see the flat shoulder bone and the long bones making up the arm? The bones in different vertebrates’ limbs look very similar.

QUESTIONS Do you remember what a skeleton’s function is? List as many of the functions of the skeleton as you can think of in your exercise books. Vertebrate animals can move because of two really important things: 1. They have joints between their bones that can let their bones move. 2. Their muscles are attached to their skeletons. If you want to know how an animal moves you need to know how their joints and their muscles work. New words • ligament • tendon • joint NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 442018/05/18 10:31:53 AM 45Chapter 2: Animal skeletons45 Joints Joints are the places where bones come together. They come together in a special way to allow the animal or human to move – like at your elbow or wrist. There are different kinds of joints. Thigh bone Knee cap Knee joint Ligament This is a knee joint. Can you see that it is where the bones of the leg come together? QUESTIONS List 4 other places in your skeleton where you have a joint in your exercise books. How do the bones and the joints move? Let us look at an example of the arm moving. Look at the pictures on page 46. There are two muscles that enable your arm to move – your tricep and bicep. They work as a pair. To bend your arm, the bicep muscle “contracts” and pulls on the radius bone. Your arm then bends at the elbow joint. Visit Types of Joints video: goo.gl/5BhaI NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 452018/05/18 10:31:54 AM Life and living46 To straighten your arm, the tricep muscle “contracts” and pulls on the ulna bone. bicep radius ulna tricep bicep tricep elbow joint The arm moves using muscles, joints and bones. ACTIVITY 2.3: Describing movement in vertebrates INSTRUCTIONS: Now that you know that bones and joints are controlled by muscles to get you to move, let’s look at some of the ways that muscles and bones can make you and other vertebrates move! 1. Play charades in two or four teams in your class. a. Your teachers will put the names of different animals in a hat. b. A person from one team pulls an animal’s name from the hat. c. They may not make any noise or make any signals that will give the animal away! d. They need to mime the movement of this animal to their group. e. Three people in their group may have a turn to guess which animal they are miming. If all three get it wrong then the other team can guess what the animal is. If they cannot get it right then the ‘mime-artist’ must reveal their animal. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 462018/05/18 10:31:54 AM 47Chapter 2: Animal skeletons47 Points will be awarded as follows: • 5 points for the first guess that is correct ... If this guess was wrong ... • 4 points for the next guess that gets it correct ... If this guess is wrong ... • 3 points for the next guess that gets it correct ... If this guess is wrong, ask the other team but the mime is not allowed to demonstrate their action again. • 2 points for the other team if someone gets it correct the first try. If they get it wrong then ... • 1 point for the last try. If they get it wrong then no points are awarded. 2. Choose three of the animal movements that your friends mimed that you really liked. Write down for each of these: a. The bones that were used to create that movement in the animal. b. The joints that were part of the movement. c. The muscles that controlled the movement. KEY CONCEPTS • A vertebrate skeleton (inside the body) has bones and joints. • Bones are strong and form a strong frame structure. • A skeleton protects the body. • A skeleton supports the body. • Vertebrate animals can move because they have muscles attached to the skeleton.

In this chapter we will investigate two kinds of structures, frame and shell structures. 3.1 Structures A structure is something that is arranged or put together in a specific way, and is made up of different parts. A jungle gym is an example of a structure. It has many different parts like beams, ropes, and bars, which are put together in a special way. A jungle gym is a type of structure. 1, 2 Most structures are designed to remain stable and rigid, which means they should not break, crumble or topple and fall over if something heavy is placed on top of or against them. New words • frame structure • shell structure • enclose • resist • load NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 502018/05/18 10:31:54 AM 51Chapter 3: Skeletons as structures51 Structures have different jobs or functions: • Support • Protect • To enclose, which means they keep something in or they keep things from getting in (like a tin of juice or a fence around a building). • Help with movement We get three kinds of structures: • Frame structures • Shell structures • Solid structures In all structures, the shape of the structure is very important. A structure will be able to resist or hold a certain weight depending on its shape. In Grade 4 we looked at strong frame structures and also how to make structures stronger using struts and braces. In this chapter in Life and Living, we are going to focus on two kinds of structures: frame structures and shell structures. This is because they relate to the skeletons of animals. QUESTIONS Turn to a friend and talk about the words “shell structure” and “frame structure”. What could these mean? Then think of examples of frame and shell structures that you can see in buildings or perhaps on your walk or ride to school. Report back and discuss these with your class. Frame structures Frame structures are easy to identify because they have a frame or a skeleton. These structures are built or put together by attaching pieces of material together to make a frame. Look at the photos of frame structures on page 52. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 512018/05/18 10:31:54 AM Life and living52 Construction workers use All of the triangles in these scaffolding. The scaffolding bridges make them strong forms a frame. frame structures. A pylon is a frame structure The veins in a leaf form a that supports electricity lines. 3 frame structure. 4 A spider’s web is a frame structure. 5 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 522018/05/18 10:31:55 AM 53Chapter 3: Skeletons as structures53 QUESTIONS Turn to a friend and discuss what you think all these structures have in common – what is the same? Report back to your class. One of the most important frame structures for all vertebrate animals is their skeleton. The material used to make this frame is bone that is attached to the muscles that move the skeleton. The skeleton supports the muscles and protects the organs. Here is a picture of a human rib cage. Can you see how it makes a frame structure? The rib cage is a frame structure. QUESTIONS Which organs does the rib cage protect? In general, we can say that all vertebrates have a frame structure as a skeleton. This is because vertebrates have an endoskeleton, which makes a frame to support the body. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 532018/05/18 10:31:55 AM Life and living54 Shell structures Shell structures generally hold or protect things inside the structure. Humans make shell structures to protect and hold things, like a dish, a tin, a car or house. A car has a shell structure, These guavas are kept which protects the passengers in a basket, which is a shell inside. 6 structure. 7 In nature eggshells and the exoskeletons of invertebrates, like crab and crayfish shells, are examples of shell structures. Shell structures are made to resist a very heavy load. An egg shell is an example A crab has an exoskeleton of a strong shell structure. 8 which is a shell structure. 9 Strengthening structures Structures that protect something or hold a weight without breaking or falling, need to be really strong. Let’s investigate the different ways we can use to strengthen a structure. Did you know? It is almost impossible to crush an egg shell if you hold it vertically between your thumb and index finger! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 542018/05/18 10:31:55 AM 55Chapter 3: Skeletons as structures55 Do you remember in Grade 4 Matter and Materials when we looked at whether a triangle or a square was stronger? Look at the pictures to remind yourself. Creating a square and a triangle shape. QUESTIONS When you press on the shapes as in the picture, which shape is the most stable and rigid? Explain how you could make the other shape stronger and more stable. Corners in structures are very important because it is often the weakest point of a structure. To strengthen corners you can: • Put another support (called a brace) across a rectangle’s corner to make a triangle. The corner is then made much stronger. Diagonal piece of wood A diagonal brace on a corner where two pieces of wood meet. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 552018/05/18 10:31:55 AM Life and living56 • Place a triangular patch over the corner. This is called a gusset. Another way of strengthening a corner so it can’t collapse, called a gusset. ACTIVITY 3.1: Making and designing a skeleton The local museum has asked your school if they have any models of vertebrate skeletons for a display. Mothusi had an idea. She loves making things and she also loves animals. So Mothusi suggested making our own animal skeleton models. We can then better understand the idea of skeletons as structures and use these models to put on display. Can we make our own animal skeletons? As a project, you need to design and make a skeleton for a vertebrate. This will be a frame structure. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 562018/05/18 10:31:56 AM 57Chapter 3: Skeletons as structures57 You may use the following materials: • Drinking straws • Rolled up paper for members and struts • Wooden dowels or sticks (30cm x 10 mm) • Cellotape • Metal paper fasteners INVESTIGATE: Let’s investigate and do some research around how to build a shell or frame structure. We looked at different ways to strengthen structures using special shapes and struts. Remember this when you are investigating and designing your skeleton. DESIGN: Now you need to use the information we found out to come up with a design for your skeleton. Your skeleton should have the following specifications: • It must be three-dimensional. • It must look realistic. • It must have or show the basic parts, (for example skull, backbone, ribs). • It must be strong and rigid so it can stand on its own. Your design has the following constraints: • You cannot make your skeleton at home – you must make it at school. • You are confined to using some of the following tools and materials: waste paper (A4 and A3), card, brass paper fasteners, glue, scissors, wooden sticks and nails (to make holes). Once you have thought about these specifications, you need to answer these questions: 1. What do you need to design? 2. What will the size and shape of your skeleton be? Remember that your skeleton must stand up straight for at least three minutes. 3. What materials are you going to use to build your skeleton? Make a list of all the materials you will need. Visit Need ideas on how to build a skeleton from rolled-up newspaper? goo.gl/YNFcP NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 572018/05/18 10:31:56 AM Life and living58 4. What tools are you going to need to make your skeleton? 5. Are there any other specifications and constraints that you can think of for your skeleton? Now you need to draw some designs for your skeleton. Use scrap pieces of paper to do your first designs. Once you are happy with your design, draw your final design in your exercise book. Label your drawing, showing what materials you are going to use for the different parts. MAKE: Now comes the fun part! You have to make your skeleton according to your sketch and using the materials you identified. Do this in class. Once you have all finished making your skeletons, you need to show your classmates what you made and tell you what you did to make your skeleton. This is called presenting your design. EVALUATE: Answer the following questions about your skeleton. 1. Did your skeleton stand up for three minutes without your support? 2. What could you change in your skeleton to make it work better? 3. Did your skeleton fulfil all the requirements in the specifications given to you? 4. If you ever had to build this skeleton again, what would you do differently? COMMUNICATE: An important part of the design process is to communicate what you found to others so they can learn from what you did. Write a paragraph where you tell Mothusi about the skeleton that you built. What worked and what did not work? This is so that she can learn from what you did and also build a model skeleton to put on display at the museum. Did you know? When making your skeleton, you may come up with a better design! So do a second drawing if needed. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 582018/05/18 10:31:56 AM 59Chapter 3: Skeletons as structures59 KEY CONCEPTS • Structures can be shaped as a shell or frame. • Structures have specific functions – to protect, support, enclose or help to move. • Shell and frame structures can be found in nature. • Structures can be strengthened. • Struts can strengthen structures.

Who is the most important? Some animals stood on the soft green grass around the waterhole one day, admiring the fine job that the maker had done! The tortoise, slowly and carefully said: “Of all creation I think I like the flamingos the best! Their beautiful pink and white feathers, their graceful necks and long legs – they’re just amazing! They are so beautiful maybe they’re the most important.” Warthog just humfed and rolled in the squishy brown mud, munching on some roots. “Those flamingos are far too delicate!” said the hungry springbok, “Look at that strong, fearsome buffalo – no one ever messes with him! His horns are so sharp he can pierce a rock! I think he is the most important in all creation!” New words • photosynthesis • by-product • producer • consumer • food chain • food web NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 612018/05/18 10:31:57 AM Life and living62 Warthog just humfed and sat on the cool green grass taking a huge tasty mouthful. The baboon jumped from his perch in a nearby tree “Hahaha-ing” and “KwahKwahKwah-ing” as he went. “You are all so wrong! Look at the eagle – she soars over everyone and can see everything. She is always safe high in the cliffs and never has to come to this messy old waterhole. She doesn’t need us – she is the most important of everyone!” Warthog just humfed and scratched his back against the rough hard bark of a baobab tree. The dungbeetle clambered on top of his ball, rested his head on his hand and said: “You have no idea – the ants, now they’re an important bunch. Without those little fellows the entire world would be covered in dead stuff. The smell would be un-be-lie-va-ble! They are the most important by far!” Warthog humfed and this time it was really loud – “HUMF” he humfed again. “Without plants we’d all be gone!” and with that he shoved a clump of reeds and munched at the little insects escaping. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 622018/05/18 10:31:57 AM 63Chapter 4: Food chains63 Photosynthesis Plants make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. • They absorb water and nutrients through their roots. • The water travels to the leaf or stem where the plant produces the food. • Plants use carbon dioxide from the air and sunlight energy for this process. • The plants use the water and carbon dioxide gas with the sunlight energy to make food that we call sugars. • They give off oxygen as a by-product of this process. • The plant can then use the food (sugars) that it produced to carry out the life processes. • Plants generally make far more food than they need so they store the extra food in different parts of the plant. • Animals then eat these parts of the plant (or the whole plant) to get food.

Discuss this with a friend and report back to the class. What would you be prepared to pay for a day’s worth of oxygen? Plants make this all for free for us! In this way, the warthog was completely right: “Without plants we would all be gone!” We would not have food to eat and we would not have oxygen to breathe. The sun is a source of energy for all living things on Earth. 1 Producers and consumers In the beginning of this term you learnt that animals and plants are interdependent. That means they need each other and depend on each other to survive. All living plants and animals need food to give them energy in order to survive. Plants can make their own food through photosynthesis. Living things that make their own food are called producers because they produce their own food. QUESTIONS Work with a friend and take turns to explain what ‘ingredients’ a plant uses during the process of photosynthesis. What do the plants make or produce from this? Write your answers in your exercise books. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 642018/05/18 10:31:58 AM 65Chapter 4: Food chains65 If an animal needs energy it cannot use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide like a plant does to make food. Animals need to eat plants to get energy to carry out their life processes. Living things that get their energy by eating either plants or animals are called consumers. • Many animals eat plants to get energy. We call these animals herbivores. • Some animals eat other animals to get energy. We call these animals carnivores. • Other animals eat both plants and animals, like baboons or people. We call these animals omnivores. • We get special animals called scavengers and decomposers. They eat dead animals and break their bodies into tiny pieces that can go into the soil as compost. These pieces must be small enough for plants to absorb. A cow is a herbivore. 2 A baboon is an omnivore. 3 Lions are carnivores. 4, 5 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 652018/05/18 10:31:58 AM Life and living66 ACTIVITY 4.1: Identifying herbivores, omnivores, carnivores, scavengers and decomposers MATERIALS: • Books and reading material on all sorts of animals displayed in class. • Do research in your local library or on the Internet for information on one of the animals on page 67. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Identify the different animals on page 67. Work with a friend and see if you can name as many of the animals as possible. 2. What do the animals eat? 3. Classify the animals as a herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, scavenger or decomposer. 4. Select three of each and record them in the table in your exercise books.

They do not eat plants. There is a feeding relationship between producers and consumers. We call this relationship a food chain: • Plants are the producers. • Animals are the consumers. A food chain shows how each organism gets food, and how energy is passed from one organism to the next. When we draw a food chain we use an arrow ( → ) between organisms to show that one eats the other and that energy is transferred from the one organism to the next. A simple food chain is: grass → cow → human. Food chains that are interdependent and linked are called food webs. LeafCaterpillarChameleon SnakeMongoose A simple food chain. Can you name the herbivores, carnivores and scavenger?

If you use glue, hold the ends together with washing pegs until the glue has dried. • Scrap paper, colouring pencils (or cut out pictures of animals and insects) • Scissors and glue • Thumbtacks and Prestik INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Cut the paper into long strips, 3 cm wide. 2. Use the colours like this: a. Green strips for the producers – the plants. b. One colour for the consumers – the animals eating the plants. (You could even have two colours here – one for herbivores, and one for carnivores and omnivores.) 3. Design your own food chain. Remember to start with the producers then add in consumers. To show the flow of energy you must use an arrow (→). 4. Collect pictures of the animals in your food chain. Or draw your own pictures on scrap paper and cut these out carefully. 5. Put your chain together as follows: a. Start with the green strip for the plants. Staple the two ends together to form a link on a chain. Stick your picture of the plant in your food chain on. Two links in the chain so far – a green plant and the first consumer (a herbivore). Visit Food chains (video) goo.gl/MSO2f NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 692018/05/18 10:31:59 AM Life and living70 b. Use the same amount of ‘consumer coloured’ strips as the amount of consumers in your food chain. Stick the pictures of your consumers in order onto these strips. A longer chain – remember your chain will have pictures of the plants and animals on each link! 6. Pin your food chain to the ceiling. It should look like a large spider web when everyone’s chains are up. 7. Use string or wool to show this interdependency. So you can see that food webs show how food chains are linked. The organisms that make up a food chain cannot be in any random order. They have to be in the specific order in which the energy is transferred between them in an ecosystem. Let’s have a look at re-ordering food chains that are broken. ACTIVITY 4.3: Sequencing plants and animals in food chains INSTRUCTIONS: 1. The following lists of animals and plants are in the wrong order. 2. You must sequence them so that they make up a proper food chain in which the energy is transferred from one organism to the next. 3. Make sure to draw an arrow from one organism to the next to show the direction. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 702018/05/18 10:31:59 AM 71Chapter 4: Food chains71 4. You can even draw some pictures of the animals in your exercise books if you want to. Grasshopper, Hawk, Snake, Grass Shrimp, Seal, Fish, Algae Bee, Daisy flower, Butcher bird, Spider Mouse, Jackal, Leopard, Grass Are humans also part of a food chain? Most humans are omnivores and like to eat plant and animal products. QUESTIONS What do you call a human herbivore? Let’s look where humans fit into food chains. ACTIVITY 4.4: Discovering your place in different food chains MATERIALS: A list of all you ate and drank from when you woke up yesterday morning to when you went to sleep last night. INSTRUCTIONS: Copy the table below in your exercise books and order everything you ate and drank in a day into the different categories. Plants I ate were: I drank the juice of plants when I drank: I ate animal products when I ate: I drank animal products when I drank: I ate a combination of animal and plant products when I ate: NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 712018/05/18 10:32:00 AM Life and living72 QUESTIONS: 1. Now design a food chain of some of the plant and animal food products that you ate. 2. Why do you think people say that human beings are “at the top of the food chain”? Wow, I feel really humbled by our place in the food chain. Although we are “at the top” it also means we have a lot of responsibility to be conscious of what we eat. ACTIVITY 4.5: Write a food chain poem MATERIALS: • The habitat and animal books on display in your class • Scrap paper for planning and drafting INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Write a food chain poem. 2. The heading of your poem must describe or label the type of habitat in which the food chain is located. 3. The body must explain the flow of energy in the food chain. 4. The ending must repeat the heading and your name. 5. Use a thesaurus to get ideas for different verbs instead of only using “eat”. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 722018/05/18 10:32:00 AM 73Chapter 4: Food chains73 Here is an example of a food chain poem written by Mothusi: The Savannah There are the lion cubs that were fed by the graceful lioness that caught the zebra that munched the grass that grows on the savannah where Mothusi lives! KEY CONCEPTS • Green plants make their own food to build their branches and stems. • Green plants use water, carbon dioxide and sunlight energy to make food. • Plants are called producers. • Animals need food to grow and carry out the life processes. • Animals cannot make their own food and have to eat plants or other animals for food. Animals are called consumers. • Food chains describe the feeding relationships between plants and animals. • Energy is transferred from the sun to green plants, and then to the animals in the food chain. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 732018/05/18 10:32:00 AM Life and living74 REVISION Read the information and look at the pictures below. Then answer the questions that follow. The rodent is not in his shelter. The bird of prey sees the rodent, dives from above and catches the rodent. The bird of prey is at the top of the food chain. The rodent eats the beetle. Energy passes from the lettuce through the snail and then the beetle to the rodent. Lettuce grows by extracting water from the soil, as well as energy from the sun that shines on the leaves. Nutritious matter is manufactured there. It helps the plant to grow. The snail eats a lettuce leaf to survive. The beetle devours the snail, and then has enough energy to hunt for the next snail. If one of these are removed from the food chain permanently, the food chain is broken, and the others in the food chain are affected. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 742018/05/18 10:32:00 AM 75Chapter 4: Food chains75 1. Write a five link food chain using the information and pictures on page 74. 2. Which organisms are herbivore? 3. Which organisms are carnivores? 4. The energy flow in this food chain started with a main source of energy. What source of energy provided this energy? 5. Explain the interdependence in this food chain. 6. What would happen if the eagle was removed from this food chain? 7. The eagle got old and died. Explain how the eagle’s body was broken down and became part of the soil. Give examples of animals that helped this process. 8. Look at the following picture of a food chain. Name the producer, the herbivore and the carnivores. GrassGrasshopperMouseOwl 9. The mouse also eats other plants, such as seeds and nuts. So the mouse is not only a carnivore. What is it? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 752018/05/18 10:32:00 AM 76 5 Life cycles KEY QUESTIONS • Why do chickens lay eggs but dogs do not? • When we were at the pond I found some frogspawn. Why are the frog eggs soft but the chicken eggs are hard? I thought eggs had hard shells that can crack and break? • Our puppies looked similar to the mother dog but the tadpoles I found in the pond did not look like frogs at all. I wonder why? • Our puppies are a year old now and look very similar to the adult dogs – will they still change a lot? When will I know that they are adult dogs? This term we studied many of the different plants and animals on Earth and their interdependence in different habitats. In this section we are going to finish our study of plants and animals, and look specifically at their life cycles. 5.1 Growth and development Plants and animals grow and develop throughout their lives. QUESTIONS When will you stop growing? Discuss this with a friend and then share your ideas with the class. All plants and animals need to make new plants and animals, or they will become extinct and no longer exist on Earth. The adult plant or animal needs to produce offspring that will grow over time into new adults, which will produce offspring of their own. We call this a life cycle. New words • generation • life cycle • offspring • maturation NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 762018/05/18 10:32:01 AM 77Chapter 5: Life cycles77 It is a cycle because when a new plant or animal is made the cycle begins again. The plant or animal can die anywhere in its life cycle – at birth, or as a young or old plant or animal. Let’s take a closer look at the life cycle of flowering plants. 5.2 Plant life cycles In flowering plants, the life cycle begins when a seed germinates. Look at the diagram showing the seed after it has germinated. Leaves Radicle Lateral roots The development stages in a plant’s germination and growth. The seed germinates when a small root (radicle) and stem start to grow out of the seed. This grows into a young plant. A very young plant just after it has germinated and begun to grow. 1 New words • fertilization • radicle • ovules • development stages Visit Growth of a seed (video). goo.gl/qj4M4 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 772018/05/18 10:32:01 AM Life and living78 The plant grows and develops into a seedling. In time the seedling grows and matures into a young adult plant that is bigger. The young adult plant continues to mature and becomes a mature adult plant. The adult plant can reproduce using flowers that produce seeds. The plant reaches maturity when it makes flowers. QUESTIONS Look at the three different photos below. What do you think the insects in these photos are doing? A fly 2 A bee 3 A butterfly 4 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 782018/05/18 10:32:02 AM 79Chapter 5: Life cycles79 The flowers produce pollen and unfertilised seeds (these can’t yet grow new plants). Insects carry the pollen from one flower to the next. This is called pollination: • The pollen fertilises the ovules in the flower. • Fertilised ovules then develop into seeds. • The seeds are then dispersed in a new place. • Seeds can be dispersed in different ways. • When a seed lands in soil it can start to germinate. The life cycle begins again. Animals Water Wind Explosion Different methods for seed dispersal QUESTIONS Why does a plant need to disperse its seeds? Look at the pictures showing ways in which seeds are dispersed. Discuss these four ways and explain how you think the seeds are adapted in each method to be the most efficient.

Carefully place the tadpoles in the water habitat. 4. Change the water at least every second day. 5. Feed the tadpoles with fish flakes. 6. Keep a diary of the tadpoles’ growth and development over the next few weeks: DateDescription of your observations Sketch of your observations Stages in the animal life cycle Most animals, like fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, have a simple life cycle. We can identify different stages in such a simple life cycle: • Gestation or pregnancy – before birth • Growth and development • Maturation • Reproduction The gestation stage in an animal’s life is the time before the embryo (young animal) is born. Animals produce young in different ways: • Live birth: Some animals grow inside the womb of the mother animal and are then born alive. • Hatch from eggs: The mother animal lays eggs and the embryos develop inside the eggs before hatching. • Hatch from eggs inside the mother animal’s body and are then born alive: The embryo develops within an egg inside the mother animal’s body. The eggs can hatch just before or just after birth.

In a chicken, the mother lays an egg and the embryo develops in the egg before hatching. Animals grow and change after birth or after hatching from their eggs. Some animals undergo a simple change. For example, in dogs the puppy looks similar to the adult dog. In dogs the puppy looks similar to the adult dog. Other animals, mostly amphibians and insects, hatch looking completely different to the adult animal. They go through very big changes in their life cycle. This change is called a metamorphosis. Look at the stages of metamorphosis of a monarch butterfly. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 832018/05/18 10:32:04 AM Life and living84 A monarch caterpillar eats and grows. The caterpillar gets ready to make a pupa. Inside the pupa the caterpillar is changing into a butterfly. The adult butterfly emerges from the pupa. ACTIVITY 5.3: Observing fruit fly reproduction MATERIALS: • Clear plastic bottle • Sharp knife • Ripe fruit INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Cut the top part of the plastic bottle off. 2. Put ripe fruit in the bottle. (Be careful – if the fruit is too watery, the flies will die.) 3. Put the top upside down in the bottle as if this is a funnel. Look at the picture below.

At maturation the female produces egg cells and the male produces sperm cells. When they mate the male sperm cells will fertilise the female egg cells and start the life cycle all over again. Fertilisation is when a male sperm enters the female egg. An animal can die at any stage in its life cycle. Various things can cause death to the animal. QUESTIONS Discuss in your group what the causes of death for an animal could be and write them below. ACTIVITY 5.4: The frog life cycle INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Hopefully you were able to see some tadpoles develop into frogs. 2. Let’s revise the stages of a frog’s life cycle. Look at the illustration on page 87. 3.

In this chapter we will learn about metals and non-metals. Do you remember learning about materials in Grade 4? Metals and non-metals are two different classes of materials. Each class has its own unique properties. Properties are those things that are special about an object or a material. We can use the properties of a material to describe what it is like. For example, we could say that a property of gases is that they can be compressed. When we want to make a new product (a building, a tool or any kind of object) we first have to decide what the purpose of that product will be. Perhaps we want to make a tool for digging in the garden, or a kennel (dog house) for our new puppy. The purpose of the product will help us decide what would be the best material to make the object from. What would be the best material for a digging tool? Surely we would need a tool that is strong and durable; with a sharp edge that will allow us to cut through the soil when we dig into it. QUESTIONS 1. What material would allow us to make a dog house that is cool in summer and warm in winter? 2. What material would you choose to make a spade for digging in the garden? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 922018/05/18 10:32:09 AM 93Chapter 6: Metals and non-metals93 The next activity is about the things we think about when we choose materials for a specific purpose. In this case the purpose is building a house. ACTIVITY 6.1: Choosing materials to build a house INSTRUCTIONS: 1. When we choose a material for a certain purpose, we look for a material with the right properties for the job. Look at the two pictures of houses below. 2. Can you see that house A and house B are made of different materials? 3. Answer the questions that follow. AB QUESTIONS: 1. What material was used to build house A? 2. What material was used to build house B? 3. If you had to build a house next to the ocean, which one would you choose, house A or house B? 4. Write a reason why you would build this house next to the ocean, rather than the other one. 5. Write down at least three other materials that could be used for building a house. We have looked at the different types of materials that you could use to build a house. You have seen that there are different cases when you would use one material or another. Now let’s look at the actual properties of metals and non-metals. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 932018/05/18 10:32:09 AM Matter and materials94 6.1 Properties of metals So how can we tell if something is made of metal? Good question Walt! Let’s look at the properties of metals. A property is a word used to describe a material or object and tells us something about it. • Metals are usually shiny. The shine that we see when light reflects off the surface of a metal is called the lustre of the metal. • Most metals are hard and they feel heavy. • We say metals are dense as they have particles which are packed close together. • Metals conduct electricity and heat well. (Next term you will learn more about electricity in Energy and Change. In Grade 6 you will learn more about metals as conductors of electricity.) • Metals are malleable (they can be shaped into flat sheets) and they are ductile (this means they can be pulled into thin wire). • Most metals can be heated to high temperatures without melting or changing their shape, which is one of the reasons why pots and pans are made of metal. Can you think of any other reasons why pots and pans are made of metal? • Metals are mined from the Earth. You will learn more about this in another subject, Social Sciences. New words • property • metal • lustre/lustrous • dense • conduction • electricity • malleable • ductile NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 942018/05/18 10:32:10 AM 95Chapter 6: Metals and non-metals95 Aaah! All these new words about metals! I still do not really know what they all mean? Do not worry Walt! These are new, big words but here is an activity where we can investigate some of the properties of metals. We will use our skills of observation (looking, listening and touching) during the investigation. INVESTIGATION 6.1: What are the properties of metals? Walt identified a problem and a question – he wants to experience the properties of metals. In a Science investigation we want to answer a question or find something out. AIM: What would you like to find out in this investigation? (We call this the aim of the investigation.) MATERIALS: • Coins • Metal spoon, pencil sharpener and nail or screw • Paper clip or thumb tack • Pin • Steel wool • Metal bottle cap NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 952018/05/18 10:32:10 AM METHOD: 1. A few metal objects have been placed in front of you. Notice all the different shapes. Write the name of each object in the table below. 2. Hold each object in your hand. Does it feel hot or cold? Rough or smooth? 3. Look at each object carefully. Is it shiny or dull? Can you describe its colour? 4. Drop each object on the floor, or tap it. What sound does it make? 5. Write your observations in the table. You may use words from the box below or use your own words. shiny, dull, rough, hard, smooth, makes a ringing sound, cold, warm, heavy, rigid, sharp, flexible, soft, light OBSERVATIONS: Name of the object How the object feels when I touch it What the object looks like The sound that is made when the object is tapped or dropped CONCLUSION: What have you learned from investigating the properties of metals? Remember when we looked at the two different houses made from tin and wood? Metals are used to make objects because of the properties that they have. Matter and materials96 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 962018/05/18 10:32:10 AM 97Chapter 6: Metals and non-metals97 ACTIVITY 6.2: The properties of metals make them useful to make things INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Now that you have investigated the properties of metals, look at the following photos of different objects made from metal. 2. Answer the questions about each object. Metal pot 1 3.

If the spanner was made from plastic, do you think it would work as well? Why? Coins are made from different metals. 9. Why do you think coins are made from metals? A tank made from corrugated iron. 2 Did you know? Gold is malleable enough for just one gram to be hammered into a sheet that is one square meter in size. Gold can also be made so thin that it appears transparent! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 982018/05/18 10:32:11 AM 99Chapter 6: Metals and non-metals99 10. This structure is made from sheets of corrugated iron metal. What property of metal allows people to make sheets of metal like this? We have said that metals are shiny (they have lustre). But sometimes, when metal gets old it becomes dull. If something is dull, it has lost its shine. There are ways to make metals shiny again. ACTIVITY 6.3: How can dirty copper coins be cleaned? INSTRUCTIONS: 1. In this activity, you will not be given the list of materials and a method to follow. 2. Rather, you have to come up with your own steps in this activity to answer the question. 3. Your teacher will place various objects in front of you or the class. 4. Experiment with the objects and see how you can best answer the question for this investigation. QUESTIONS: 1. What question were you trying to answer in this investigation? 2. Write the list of materials that you needed for this activity. Write it in a bulleted list. 3. Imagine you have to tell the Quantum Club how to do this activity to answer your question. Write down the steps to follow to do this activity. Use your experience from experimenting with the objects to come up with a method for the activity. Remember to number the steps in the method. 4. What can you conclude was the best and quickest way to make dull metal shiny again? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 992018/05/18 10:32:11 AM Matter and materials100 6.2 Properties of non-metals How can we tell if something is made of a non-metal? Non-metals are materials that do not have the same properties as metals: • Non-metals are not shiny but tend to be dull. • Many non-metals are not bendy but brittle. This means that they will break when we try to bend them with enough force. • Non-metals do not conduct electricity or heat well. We call them insulators. Can you think of a reason why pots and pans often have plastic or wooden handles? This kettle is made from metal and has a plastic handle. In the next activity we will investigate some of the properties of non-metals. We will test and observe the non-metals in the same way that we tested the metals in Investigation 6.1. This is so that we can compare metals and non-metals later on. New words • non-metal • dull • brittle • insulator NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1002018/05/18 10:32:11 AM 101Chapter 6: Metals and non-metals101 INVESTIGATION 6.2: The properties of non-metals AIM: What do you want to find out by doing this investigation? MATERIALS: • Paper or cardboard • Cotton wool • Fabric • Plastic spoon • Cork • Sponge • Piece of chalk • Small, strong glass IMPORTANT! Do not drop this on the floor! METHOD: 1. A few non-metal objects have been placed in front of you. Write the name of each object in the table on page 102. 2. Hold each object in your hand. Does it feel hot or cold? Rough or smooth? 3. Look at each object carefully. Is it shiny or dull? Can you describe its colour? 4. Drop each object on the floor, or tap it. What sound does it make? 5. Write your observations in the table. You may use words from the box below or use your own words. shiny, dull, rough, hard, smooth, makes a ringing sound, cold, warm, heavy, rigid, sharp, flexible, soft, light NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1012018/05/18 10:32:11 AM Matter and materials102 OBSERVATIONS: Name of the object How the object feels when I touch it What the object looks like The sound that is made when the object is tapped or dropped CONCLUSION: What have you learnt from investigating the properties of non-metals? 6.3 Comparing metals and non-metals What have we learnt about the properties of metals and non-metals? Now we are ready to compare the properties of metals and non-metals. Read through the two lists below. Do you agree with the properties that have been listed? Are there other properties that you would like to add? Most metals: • Solid and strong • Malleable and ductile (This means they can be hammered or bent into different shapes.) • Shiny or silvery (lustrous), especially when they are new • Cold to the touch Non-metals: • Can be soft or flexible, like rubber • Can be hard and brittle, like glass • Do not have a silvery (lustrous) appearance, but tend to be dull • Can be grouped into different categories (ceramics, wood, rubber, plastic, glass, etc.) • Usually feels neither cold nor warm. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1022018/05/18 10:32:11 AM 103Chapter 6: Metals and non-metals103 KEY CONCEPTS • Every type of matter has its own set of properties. • Shiny, brittle, malleable and dense are all examples of the properties of materials. There are many more examples. • Metals and non-metals have different properties. • Materials are useful because of their properties. • Metals are mined from the Earth. REVISION 1. What does the word ‘property’ mean? 2. How can we tell if something is made of metal? 3. What does it mean to ‘use our skills of observation’? 4. Design an investigation in which you are trying to work out whether an object is made of metal or a non-metal. You do not need to write out the materials and apparatus you will need. Rather, explain in a paragraph about the different types of tests you would do to determine if something is made of metal or non- metal. 5. Sometimes, just using one property to classify an object or material as a metal or non-metal might not be enough. For example, plastic is flexible but strong, so does this make it a metal? The answer is no. Another example is glass. Glass is also hard, but is it strong? What other properties does glass have which make it a non-metal or metal? Now that we have learnt about metals and non-metals, let’s see how we use metals in the world around us. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1032018/05/18 10:32:11 AM 104 7 Uses of metals KEY QUESTIONS • How can we use the special properties of metals (magnetism, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity) to our advantage? • Which additional properties of metals make them so suitable for use in items such as jewellery, coins, buildings, vehicles, furniture and kitchen utensils? We have learnt that, whenever we wish to make something new, we first have to decide what the purpose of that product will be. Since we are learning about Matter and Materials, let us assume that the product will be a tool or any other kind of object that will be doing a job for us. Once we have decided what the purpose of the object will be, we can choose a material with the right properties for the job. 7.1 Special properties of metals In this chapter we will learn about some of the uses of metals. The properties of metals make them suitable materials for many different objects. We will soon investigate some special properties of metals that we have not thought about yet. Metals and magnets Have you ever played with magnets? Did you notice how magnets attract other magnets, and also certain metal objects? In the next activity we will investigate magnetism and write our findings in a table. New words • conductivity • thermal • magnetic • scrap metal • rust • corrosion • tarnish NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1042018/05/18 10:32:12 AM 105Chapter 7: Uses of metals105 ACTIVITY 7.1: Learning about magnetism MATERIALS: • Metal objects: Coins, spoon, pencil sharpener, nail or screw, paper clip, thumb tack, pin, steel wool, etc. • Non-metal objects: Paper or cardboard, cotton wool, fabric, plastic spoon, cork, sponge, piece of chalk, small glass • Magnet INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Sort the objects in front of you into two groups: Metals on one side and non-metals on the other. 2. Write the names of all the metal objects in the table below in your workbook. 3. Then write the names of all the non-metal objects in the table. 4. Hold each object close to the magnet to see if it is attracted to the magnet or not. 5. Write your observations in the table below. Metal object Is the object attracted to the magnet? Answer YES or NO Non-metal objects Is the object attracted to the magnet? Answer YES or NO QUESTIONS: 1. Use the information in your table to decide whether the following statements are True or False in your workbook. If the statement is True, draw a ✗ in the ‘TRUE’ column. If the statement is False, draw a ✗ in the ‘FALSE’ column. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1052018/05/18 10:32:12 AM Matter and materials106 StatementTRUEFALSE All the metal objects are attracted to the magnet. Some of the metal objects are attracted to the magnet. Some of the metal objects are not attracted to the magnet. Some of the non- metal objects are attracted to the magnet. None of the non-metal objects are attracted to the metal. 2. Write a paragraph to explain what you learnt about magnetism. What must objects be made from to be attracted to a magnet? 3. Complete the following sentence by filling in words from the box below: of the metal objects are attracted to the magnet, but of the non-metal objects are attracted to the magnet. all some none Magnetism is a very interesting property, and playing with magnets and materials is fun! Were all the metals that you tested attracted to the magnet? In the next activity we are going to test the magnetic properties of different metals. There is also a problem that Walt needs to help solve. After you have completed the activity you may be able to give him some advice on how to use magnetism to solve the problem! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1062018/05/18 10:32:12 AM 107Chapter 7: Uses of metals107 ACTIVITY 7.2: Using magnetism to solve a problem MATERIALS: • Metal pieces: iron, aluminium and copper • Magnet The problem: Walt likes to visit the junkyard to look for bits and pieces of scrap to use in his inventions. Uncle owns the junkyard. He buys all kinds of scrap metal, which he then sells to a recycling company. The recycling company pays more if the metal is sorted by type. Uncle has a problem. He does not know how to sort the metal. One day, he is talking to Walt about his problem. Uncle: “Walt, I need your advice. I know you are clever with inventions, and that you like a challenge.” Walt: “That is true, Uncle. I love a challenge! What is your problem? Maybe I can help you solve it with Science!” Uncle: “I have a huge pile of metal scrap that I need to sort. I know there is iron, aluminium and copper in the pile of metal scrap. But I have no idea how to do this! Iron and aluminium are both metals, and look very similar. Can you think of a way to help me sort them?” What do you think Walt’s advice to Uncle will be? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1072018/05/18 10:32:12 AM Matter and materials108 INSTRUCTIONS: 1. A few metal pieces have been placed in front of you. Find the label on each piece and read the name out loud. Give everyone in your group a chance to say the names of the metals. 2. Write the name of each metal in the table below. MetalColour of metal MagneticNot magnetic 3. Look at each metal carefully. Do they look the same or are they different? Can you describe the colour of each metal? Write the colour of each metal in the table. 4. Hold each metal near the magnet. If the metal is attracted to the magnet, draw a ✗ in the column ‘Magnetic’. If the metal is not attracted to the magnet, draw a ✗ in the column ‘Not magnetic’. 5. Write what Uncle should do to sort the metal scrap. It would help him if you gave him step-by-step instructions on how to sort the metals. Not all metals are magnetic. We saw how this means the property of magnetism can be put to use to sort metals. Metals and heat We will now investigate another special property of metals. But first a question: How do we cook food on the stove? We put the food inside a metal pot, and then we heat the outside of the pot. This makes the food cook on the inside. How does the heat get inside the pot? The next activity will help us answer this question.

The spoon feels cold because heat flows from to . 9. Which material (metal, plastic or wood) is the best conductor of heat? Metals and corrosion Have you ever noticed how some metal objects are shiny when they are new, but over time the shine disappears and they become dull and blotchy? The car in the picture was once shiny and new, but look at it now! It is covered in rust from standing out in the rain for so long. An old car covered in rust. 1 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1102018/05/18 10:32:13 AM 111Chapter 7: Uses of metals111 Rust has a reddish-brown colour and a rough texture. Rust is very common. It is the product that forms when iron corrodes. During corrosion, iron reacts with oxygen in the air or in water to form iron oxide (the chemical name for rust). Rust is a type of corrosion, but it is not the only type. Other types of corrosion include: • Tarnish, found on silver teapots, trays, trophies and jewellery. • Patina, the green coating that we sometimes see on copper objects. • Black spots that appear on brass. • Aluminium oxide, which is a grey-white coating that forms on aluminium. Can you see how this old Can you see the green coating cutlery is dull and tarnished? forming on this copper tap? INVESTIGATION 7.1: Learning about corrosion (rust) AIM: To find out how rust occurs. MATERIALS: • 30 identical iron nails • Three small, clean and dry containers (yogurt tubs or polystyrene cups) • Tap water • Salt water (made by dissolving ten teaspoons of salt in a litre of tap water) • Plastic wrap to cover the containers NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1112018/05/18 10:32:13 AM Matter and materials112 METHOD: 1. Mark the containers by writing A on one of them, B on the second one and C on the last one. 2. Place ten iron nails in each of the containers. 3. Pour enough tap water on the nails in container A to cover them completely. 4. Pour enough salt water on the nails in container B to cover them completely. 5. Do not pour anything on the nails in container C. 6. Cover containers A and B with plastic wrap. 7. Place the containers next to each other in a safe spot where they can be left undisturbed for a few days. 8. Check the nails in the containers every day. Every day (preferably at the same time each day) count the number of nails that have rust on them. Make sure to return the same nails to the same container after you have examined them. Continue to do this over a period of ten days. 9. Copy the following table in your exercise books and record your results.

QUESTIONS: 1. In which cup did the nails start rusting first? 2. Complete the following sentences. You may use the words in the box below, or any other words that will make the statement true for you. a. Iron rusts when it comes into contact with . b. Iron will rust more quickly in than in . • air • water • salt water 3. Can you think of ways to protect iron against rust? (Hint: Look at the following photo for a clue.) These people are painting the iron poles and fences. 2 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1132018/05/18 10:32:13 AM Matter and materials114 We have seen that iron rusts. Other metals also change when they are not protected. Have you noticed what coins look like when they are new? New coins are bright and shiny. Old coins are dull and they look dirty. That is because they have a dark layer of tarnish on them. In the next activity we will see how the layer of tarnish can be removed to make coins bright and shiny again. ACTIVITY 7.4: How can dirty copper coins be cleaned? MATERIALS: • 20 dull, dirty copper coins • Quarter cup white vinegar • One teaspoon salt • A clear, shallow bowl (not metal) • Paper towels, tissues or newspaper INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Put the salt and vinegar in the bowl. Stir until the salt dissolves. 2. Dip one coin halfway into the liquid. Hold it there for about ten seconds, then pull it out. What do you see? 3. Place all the coins into the liquid. You can watch them change for the first few seconds. After that you won’t see anything happen. 4. After five minutes, take half of the coins out of the liquid. Put them on a paper towel but do not rinse them or dry them. 5. Take the rest of the coins out of the liquid. Rinse them really well under running water, and put them on a paper towel to dry. Write “rinsed” on the second paper towel. 6. After about an hour, look at the coins on the paper towels. Write your observations in the table on page 115. Did you know? Many plastics can be made strong enough to replace metals, glass and other materials. Some cars can be made from these plastics! The plastic weighs much less than metal, and this means the car needs less energy to move around.

Why did the coins look dirty before you put them in the vinegar-and-salt mixture? 2. What happened to the coins in the vinegar-and-salt mixture? Why do you think this happened? 3. Taste a few drops of the clean vinegar. What does it taste like? NEVER taste chemicals unless your teacher says it is OK. 4. Can you think of another liquid that could be used instead of the vinegar? (Hint: What other liquids taste sour?) 5. What happened to the unrinsed coins? Did they also become clean and shiny? We are going to learn more interesting things about metals and what they are used for next. 7.2 Uses of metals Metals have thousands of uses. We use metals every day, sometimes even without knowing! Metals are ductile and good conductors of electricity. This is why metal is used to make the wire inside electrical cables. Without electrical cables we would not have electricity in our homes or schools. We would not have lights, television or telephones. (Next term we will look more at electricity!) New words • goods • durable NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1152018/05/18 10:32:13 AM Matter and materials116 Metals are extremely strong and can be turned into thin sheets. These sheets can be used to make the bodies of the cars, trucks, trains and aeroplanes that are used to transport people and goods from one place to another. Aeroplanes are made from A bridge made of metal. strong, durable sheets of metal. The strength and durability of metals make them very important as building materials, not only in visible ways (such as metal roofs and window frames), but also in invisible ways (such as metal supports inside the concrete that bridges and tall buildings are made of. Even furniture is sometimes made of metal! ACTIVITY 7.5: The uses of metals in your home INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Choose 8 metal objects from home (you could also choose your classroom). 2. Next to each metal object on your list, write why you think metal was used to make this object. You should write what property of metals makes it the best material for that particular job. 3. If you think the object could also have been made from another material, say which material. You may want to look at the example below for ideas. Did you know? South Africa has one of the biggest deposits of platinum in the world. Platinum is a very valuable and expensive metal.

The properties of the new material are often different from the properties of the materials we started with. There are many ways to process materials into new materials. There are also many reasons why we would wish to process materials into new materials. When we bake a cake, we are processing flour, eggs and other ingredients (that may not taste very nice on their own) into a cake which tastes really good! We process materials to make them stronger, or more durable, or waterproof, or even just to make them look more beautiful or interesting. New materials that form after mixing different materials are called mixtures. Mmmm! Yum! I think I am going to enjoy this chapter if we are going to be making cakes! We are going to have some fun Walt! And at the same time learn about different ways to combine materials. New words • combine • process • mixture NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1202018/05/18 10:32:15 AM 121Chapter 8: Processing materials121 8.2 Stainless steel We have learnt that iron rusts over time, and that this process speeds up when the iron is in contact with water. Have you ever noticed rust on the knives and forks in your home? Probably not! That is because they are not made of iron but of stainless steel. But what is stainless steel? ACTIVITY 8.1: A research project to learn about stainless steel Stainless steel is made by combining iron with other metals to make it stronger and to prevent rust. Processing iron with other metals to turn it into stainless steel means we can use it even in wet environments. Water taps and pipes are sometimes made of steel. Some of the instruments that doctors use to operate on sick people are made of steel. So are the pots and pans that we use when we prepare food. Stainless steel taps in the bath. Look at this shiny pot made of stainless steel. 1 INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Your task is to find out as much as possible about stainless steel. 2. You may use books or the internet, or you may ask people in your family or your community what they know about stainless steel. New words • stainless steel • report NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1212018/05/18 10:32:15 AM Matter and materials122 3. This process of finding out things about a topic is called research. You could use the following questions to guide your research: a. What is stainless steel? b. What is the main component of stainless steel? c. What other metals are in stainless steel? d. Why are other metals added to make stainless steel? e. Are there different types of stainless steel? f. What is stainless steel used for? 4. When you have gathered all your information, you should write a report with the title: Stainless steel. 5. Use pictures to make it more interesting. 8.3 Mixing materials Let’s look at more ways to combine and process materials. Mixing: Making glue Often when we mix materials together, the properties of the new material or product is different from the properties of the materials we started with. Do you remember what the word ‘property’ means from Chapter 7 when we looked at the properties of metals and non-metals? Let’s make some sticky glue to find out about this. ACTIVITY 8.2: Making glue MATERIALS: • Flour and water • Two bowls for the flour and water • Bowl for mixing • Pieces of paper INSTRUCTIONS 1. We are going to make a sticky glue paste using flour and water. New words • dissolve • solution • starting materials NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1222018/05/18 10:32:15 AM 123Chapter 8: Processing materials123 2. First you need to look at the properties of the flour and water before we mix them together. Describe the properties of the flour and water. 3. Now experiment with mixing different quantities of water and flour together to make a sticky paste. 4. See if you can stick pieces of paper together using the glue that you have made! 5. Describe the properties of the paste you have made. QUESTIONS: 1. What did the flour feel like before it was mixed with the water? 2. How would you describe the properties of plain water? 3. After mixing the flour and water together, what are the properties of the paste that you end up with? 4. Do you remember learning about the states of matter? What state of matter is the flour and water before mixing? 5. What state of matter would you say the paste is? Did you get any of the paste you made in this activity on your fingers? Perhaps it started to dry and became hard? Often when we combine materials together we have to let them set. Mixing and setting: Making jelly Have you ever tasted jelly? Jelly comes in many different colours and flavours. Which is your favourite? To make jelly, we dissolve the jelly powder in hot water. When the solution of jelly powder in water cools down, something very special happens: The solution sets, and turns into a delightfully wobbly, sweet treat! The jelly powder has been processed into something new! That is what the next activity is all about. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1232018/05/18 10:32:15 AM Matter and materials124 ACTIVITY 8.3: Making jelly MATERIALS: • Packet of jelly powder • Bowl • Cup for measuring • Hot and cold water • Spoon for mixing INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Read the instructions on the packet of jelly. 2. Pour the jelly powder into the bowl. 3. Look carefully at the dry jelly powder. What does it look like? 4. Touch the jelly powder with your finger. What does it feel like? 5. Place a few grains of the jelly powder on your tongue. What does it taste like? 6. Copy the following table in your exercise books and record your findings. PropertiesDry jelly powder (before mixing) Water (before mixing) Prepared jelly (after it has set) What does it look like? What does it feel like? What does it taste like? 7.

The mixture of sand, water and cement is called concrete. Concrete is like mud when it is wet, but when it dries out it sets into a hard, strong material. Concrete can be used to make bricks and to plaster walls. Mixing concrete using spades. Mixing concrete using a mixer. A concrete mixer. In the first picture people are using spades to mix the concrete. They use them like we would use a spoon to stir sugar into a cup of tea. The people are using their muscles to do the work required for mixing the concrete. In the second picture the machine on the right is called a cement mixer. This machine mixes all the ingredients by turning mechanically, like an electric food mixer. Electrical energy does the work required for mixing the concrete. Mixing and setting: Making bricks In the next activity we are going to make some bricks, using sand, water and some plaster of paris (a material that is very similar to cement).

Look at all the starting materials and feel them with your fingers. IMPORTANT! Do not taste any of them! 2. Copy the table below in your exercise books and record the properties of the materials. PropertiesPlaster of paris SandWater What does it look like? What does it feel like? Making sand bricks: 1. Mix some of the sand with water to make some stiff mud. Fill three or four of the hollows in the ice cube tray with the mud. 2. When these bricks are dry, they will be sand bricks. 3. Do you think they will be strong and durable? Making ‘concrete’ bricks: 1. Pour all the plaster of paris powder into the measuring tub. Measure the amount of powder in the tub by making a mark on the outside of the tub with a pen.

Pour sand into the measuring tub, up to the mark that you made in step 1. 3. Add the sand to the plaster of paris in the mixing tub. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 once more. 5. Pour water into the measuring tub, up to the mark that you made in step 1. 6. Add the water to the sand and plaster of paris and mix well with the stick. Now you have made wet ‘concrete’. You will have to work fast because it will set quickly. 7. Scoop the wet ‘concrete’ into the empty hollows of the ice tray. Fill them all to the same height so that your finished bricks all have the same size. Make the top surface of each brick flat so that they will be easy to stack later. When these bricks are dry, they will be ‘concrete’ bricks. Do you think they will be strong and durable? 8. Wash your hands very thoroughly. 9. Leave all the bricks overnight to set. When the bricks have set they can be removed from the tray and placed in a sunny spot to dry out for a few days. 10. When the bricks are dry you can use them to build something interesting. 11. Examine both types of bricks. Copy the following table in your exercise books and record your observations. PropertiesWet sand Sand brick Wet ‘concrete’ ‘Concrete’ brick What does it look like?

Do you think that sand and water alone would be good material for making bricks? Say why (or why not). 5. Did adding plaster of paris to the sand make the bricks better? In what way? 6. Can you think of other materials that we could add to the mixture of sand and plaster of paris to make the bricks even stronger and tougher? Reinforcing Real bricks are actually made by firing them in a kiln to bake them and make them hard. The potter makes objects like pots out of wet clay. Once they have dried and been fired the clay becomes hard. These clay pots have been dried and they have just been loaded into a kiln to be fired. 3 We have learnt that sometimes we can make materials stronger if we add other materials to them. When we make materials stronger by adding other materials, we say we are reinforcing it. Your bricks made of ‘concrete’ (sand and plaster of paris mixture) were stronger than the bricks made of sand only. The plaster of paris acted as binder to glue the sand grains together. In the next activity we will be looking at photos showing examples of how concrete can be reinforced. There will be some questions to help you think about each process.

The same egg looks quite different when it is cooked. Notice how the egg white is transparent when it is raw, and white when it is cooked. When it is raw, the egg is runny, like liquid. When it is cooked, the egg is solid but soft like rubber or soft plastic. Look at the following photos. A raw egg. 7 A fried (cooked) egg.

Raw materials are made into other things. When raw materials are in the form in which they are found in nature, we can call them natural materials. A natural material is any material that comes from plants, animals or the ground. We have learnt that there are many different ways in which materials can be processed to give them new properties. After processing they may look, smell, feel or taste different. They will probably also be used for a totally different purpose from before. Processed materials are materials that have been refined or built by humans from raw materials. Some examples are paper, steel and glass. ACTIVITY 9.1: Raw or processed material? Teacher note: In this activity the learners must study a list of materials and then decide which represent raw materials and which represent processed materials. It is recommended that this should be a small group activity, since discussion and joint decision-making is required.

In your exercise books, draw a new table in which you place each processed material next to the raw material that it may have been made from. For instance, in the table on page 141, bread and wheat have been placed next to each other, because bread can be made from wheat. 2. In your table, try to match up as many raw materials with processed materials as you can. 3. Which of the materials do not match any other materials? Can you think of a match for each one that does not have a match?

We already know that processed materials can be strong and durable. But what other properties do they have? Let’s look at some examples. What do you put on when it is raining outside? Some processed materials are useful to use because they are waterproof. A rain jacket is made of a material which is waterproof, and so is an umbrella. Maybe you might wear gum boots or wellingtons? These shoes are very waterproof and made from specially processed plastic and rubber. These pink gumboots are This man is wearing a rain very waterproof! jacket and has an umbrella made from waterproof materials. Paint is a processed material. Some of the pigments (colours) used to make paint are natural materials, but the final product is a processed material.

Think of all the cases where people use paint and write them down. We have just seen that processed materials can be used because they have special properties such as having colour. In the last chapter we looked at concrete and how to make concrete by combining different materials. But concrete can also be used decoratively as it has many different textures. Look at the photos on page 143 which give some idea of the different textures of concrete and how it is used to make an interesting surface!

Mothusi would love this! That is right Walt! And there are so many more properties that we could discuss, such as being fire resistant. But the best would be for you to go out and experience it for yourself. Look at the materials around you with new eyes! ACTIVITY 9.2: Investigating processed materials INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Your task is to find examples of processed materials in the world around you, particularly non-metals. 2. You must look at why that material has been used. How do its properties help it to function for us? 3. Select two different locations to look for materials. One location can be the school or classroom. The other location could be your home or your community. 4. In Chapter 2, you did an activity looking at the uses of metals. Now you must focus on the uses of non-metals that are processed materials. Wood, for example, does not fall into this category. It is a non-metal but it has not been processed. 5. You must present your findings in the way that your teacher would like it done. Perhaps as a poster – or a mini-book or a flipfile. 6. Include some pictures of the materials or drawings. You could even make rubbings of the different textures! 7. Try to find at least four different processed materials in each location. The materials must be used for different purposes and have different properties. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1442018/05/18 10:32:20 AM 145Chapter 9: Processed materials145 In the next section we will learn about some of the ways in which people processed materials in early times. Some of these traditional methods of processing materials are still used today. 9.2 Traditional processing People have been processing materials from the earliest times. In the old days only natural materials were available and people found many clever ways to make these materials more useful. The first people who lived in our land had ways to harden wood and bone for making tools and hunting weapons. They also had ways of reinforcing the mud used for making traditional huts. They knew which materials made the best clothes and blankets, and which grass made the softest beds. They also knew exactly which reeds would make the best mats to cover their walls, and how to build the best houses for their climate and lifestyle. Some of these traditional ways of processing materials are still used today. In this section we will learn more about them. ACTIVITY 9.3: Traditional materials and processing Before South Africa was a country, several interesting groups of people lived in our land. The Khoikhoi people were one of the first nations to live in southern Africa and many modern-day South Africans are descendants of the Khoikhoi. The Khoikhoi were pastoral people who kept goats, but also hunted animals for their meat and skins. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. The following story tells us about the young Khoikhoi hunter, Heitsi, who prepares to go on an expedition to hunt a springbok. 2. Read the story carefully, and look out for clues about the ways in which Heitsi’s people used and processed materials. New words • descendants • pastoral • expedition • sustainable • mould NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1452018/05/18 10:32:20 AM Matter and materials146 3. When you have read the story, answer the questions that follow. Heitsi prepares for the hunt Heitsi is getting his hunting kit ready for the hunt. He is not a man yet, but already a good hunter. When he was born 11 summers ago, his mother named him after Heitsi-eibib, who was a mythical hunter, sorcerer and warrior in the stories of his people. His father and uncles have taught him how to use the bow and arrow, and the kierie (or throwing stick), which are the traditional hunting weapons of the Khoikhoi. Heitsi is very excited about the hunt. Today he is hoping to kill a springbok, because he wants to cut a head dress for himself from the skin of the springbok. He can already imagine how envious his friends will be when he wears it proudly around his head. He will give the rest of the springbok skin to his mother to turn into a blanket (karos) or a piece of clothing for his new baby sister. His mother will scrape the skin with a sharp stone or metal blade to remove the hair. Then rub it with animal fat for a long time to make it soft. Heitsi slings the quiver in which he keeps his arrows over his shoulder. The quiver is made from tree bark. It is a good quiver, but he really wants one made of animal skin, like the one his father carries. The arrows inside the quiver have wooden shafts and sharp tips made of metal. His younger cousins have arrows with tips made of hardwood. In the old days all the arrow tips were made of wood or bone, but Heitsi’s people have been making contact with other peoples who have introduced them to metal. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1462018/05/18 10:32:20 AM 147Chapter 9: Processed materials147 He also keeps some tinder in his quiver. Tinder is the name for the soft, dry plant materials his people use when starting a fire. Another item he keeps in the quiver is a hollow reed that can be used like a straw to suck up water that has collected on the leaves of plants. He knows that he has to handle the arrow tips very carefully because they are very sharp. He keeps them sharp by rubbing them on a special stone. Another reason why Heitsi handles the arrows very carefully is because their tips have been covered with a layer of poison. His cousins sometimes use the sap from poisonous plants to treat their arrow tips, but he prefers to use snake poison because it is more potent. He picks up his bow, and admires it for a moment. He made it himself from the flexible wood of a wild olive tree. The bow string is made from the gut of a small wild cat that he hunted last summer. His uncle’s bow has a string made of twisted palm leaves. It makes a beautiful sound when he holds the end of the bow in his mouth and taps against the string with a stick. Tonight, when they return from the hunt, the men will dance around the fire while the women sing and clap their hands. There will be stories told about the hunt, and Heitsi will honour the soul of the springbok that he has killed. The last weapon he picks up is his kierie. It has a long handle and a knob at the top end. The kierie was a gift from his favourite uncle. Uncle made it himself from strong wood. To make the kierie even stronger, Uncle placed it close to the fire for a long time. The heat from the fire dried out the wood and made it tough and strong. At last Heitsi is ready for the hunt ... QUESTIONS: 1. In the story many different traditional materials used by the Khoikhoi people are mentioned. Copy the table in your exercise books. Fill in what material was Did you know? Fire-hardening is the process of removing moisture from wood (or bone) by slowly and lightly roasting it near a fire. This process makes a point (like that of a spear) or an edge (like that of a knife) stronger and more durable.

Reinforced houses Later we will read about the traditional Khoikhoi house that Heitsi and his family lived in. First we will learn about a different kind of traditional home, which is still seen today. Some of the traditional homes in Africa are made of clay or mud. In the activity to make bricks, we saw NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1482018/05/18 10:32:20 AM 149Chapter 9: Processed materials149 that mud (mixture of soil and water) is not a very strong material. When it is dry, it crumbles and collapses. When it is reinforced it can make a strong and durable building material, which can be used to build a house. If it is well- built, the house will last for many years. ACTIVITY 9.4: Making a mud house stronger In this activity we are going to look at some videos and photos for ideas on how to process mud into a strong and durable building material. If you are not able to watch the videos, then look at the photos. Many of these traditional building methods have become very popular among modern-day people who want to live in a sustainable way.

Matjieshuis of the Khoikhoi The Khoikhoi people lived here in the days before South Africa was a country. In those days there were no borders, no provinces, no towns or cities, and no roads. No-one ‘owned’ land and it belonged to everyone who lived on it! Like all early people, the Khoikhoi had to make everything they needed, because there were no shops then! They had to use whatever materials were freely available. The Khoikhoi people were nomads. That means they did not live in one place for long. They moved their homes and their belongings when the seasons changed. This way they could always be close to good grazing for their goats. Fresh green grass and trees meant there would be leaf-eating animals around to hunt. Read the story carefully for clues on which materials were used to make a traditional Khoikhoi house. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1522018/05/18 10:32:21 AM 153Chapter 9: Processed materials153 Heitsi moves house Heitsi’s clan is on the move again. A few days ago, the clan packed up all their belongings and started their long trek to the place that will be their home for the summer months. The place where they lived had become dry and dusty and it was becoming more and more difficult to find good things to eat. They took apart their hut, which they will rebuild when they reach their destination. During the long walk, everyone has to help carry. Heitsi is carrying his own sleeping mat and karos, and his hunting weapons. He also has to keep an eye on the goats in case they wander too far from the clan. After many days of walking, they come to the right place. Now they can rebuild their house. The framework of the house must be strong so that the house will stand firm. Heitsi’s mother and aunties have found some young trees nearby and are cutting long, thin branches that will be perfect for making a frame for the house. Once they have cut the branches, they strip off the leaves. The men bend the flexible branches into crescent (half- moon) shapes and tie them together with flexible strips of tree bark. This is how they build a dome-shaped framework for the house. Can you see the framework of tree branches? Can you see what the house is made of? Women attaching the reed mats to the framework.

For this reason the house is called a matjieshuis (mat-house). Heitsi’s mother and aunties made the mats by threading reeds together with string that she made from the long thin leaves of palm trees. The whole family has to help with the floor of the house. They bring clay from a nearby river and Heitsi’s mother makes the floor by stomping down the wet clay with her feet. Once the clay has dried, the floor will be smeared with animal manure. This is not as bad as it sounds – the manure seals the clay to prevent it from becoming sandy and dusty. A fire-hole will be dug in the middle of the floor, with sleeping hollows (about 15 cm deep) around it. Soft plant material will be placed in the sleeping hollows, and this will be covered with mats and karosses to make comfortable beds for Heitsi and his family. Heitsi loves his portable home. It is the perfect shelter. In hot, dry weather the openings between the reeds allow air to circulate inside the house to keep it cool. It also lets in light. He knows that when the rains come and the reed mats get wet, the reeds will absorb water and swell out. Then they will seal tight and protect the inside of the house against leaks. During the cold months, the inside of the house will also be lined with animal skins to make it extra warm and comfortable. A matjieshuis covered with material.

If you have time in class, build a model of Heitsi’s house, using any suitable building materials. We saw that Hetsie’s family uses grass to make the reed mats for their matjieshuis. In Africa, many people make objects by using plant products, called plant fibres. The people weave and stitch the plant fibres together to make different objects, such as reed mats, baskets, or even thatch to make a roof for a house. This is also a type of traditional processing.

NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1642018/05/18 10:32:24 AM 165Chapter 10: Stored energy in fuels165 10.1 What are fuels? In Grade 4, we learnt that there are many different types of energy. This year we are going to learn about stored energy and how we can use it to do something useful. QUESTIONS What do you understand by the term ‘fuel’? Discuss this word with your partner and write down your own definition. There are different definitions for fuel, but we will look at three main categories when we investigate fuels. Everyday fuels Wood comes from plants, especially trees. When plants are growing, they use the light energy from the sun (solar energy) as well as carbon dioxide and water. Plants absorb the energy and store it in their leaves, roots and other parts. Wood also contains this stored energy. Burning wood allows us to change this stored energy into light and heat, which is useful to us. This man has made a fire to Cooking meat on a fire made keep warm and provide light. 1 from wood in Khayelitsha. 2 Wood is often collected and burnt to give us heat and light. On a cold evening it is wonderful to sit around a fire to tell stories and warm yourself with friends.

Coal is a type of fossil fuel that is also burnt to provide us with heat that we can use. The heat from coal can be used to cook our food and warm our houses. Hot coals burning. Fossil fuels like coal were made from prehistoric plants. The plants got their energy from the sun and stored it in their bodies. Millions of years ago, a lot of the Earth was NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1662018/05/18 10:32:25 AM 167Chapter 10: Stored energy in fuels167 covered by water. The plants that died sank to the bottom of the water. Over millions of years, the layers of plants were covered by layers of sand and pushed down by the pressure and heat of the Earth. The plant material was buried deeper and deeper under the ground where it is much hotter than on the surface of the Earth. Over millions of years, the plant remains are changed into fossil fuels. Fossil fuels get their name ‘fossil’ because they are made from plants and animals that were alive a long, long time ago. Other types of fossil fuels are natural gas and oil. Scientists have realised that tiny sea organisms, also died, sank to the bottom of the ocean and were buried. Over millions of years, many layers of dead sea animals and plants got buried and compressed like this. Over millions of years, the dead organisms slowly changed into oil and natural gas. Wax in a candle is burnt to provide light. There is stored energy in the wax, and burning it allows us to change the stored energy into light. Candle wax is an everyday fuel that we use to give us light. Paraffin is also a fuel that contains stored energy. Paraffin is burnt in paraffin lamps and paraffin stoves to provide us with useful energy in the form of light and heat.

We get our energy from the food that we eat. Do you remember learning about food chains in the beginning of the year in Life and Living? QUESTIONS Choose one of the foods that you will eat for lunch today and draw a food chain, including this food and ending with you. Food contains stored energy that our bodies can change into useful energy that we need when we run, jump, breathe, learn – and in everything else that we do! So we can say that food is the fuel for our bodies! I must need a lot of fuel for my body as I love being active! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1682018/05/18 10:32:25 AM 169Chapter 10: Stored energy in fuels169 Food provides our bodies with energy to do things. Fuels that are burnt to get output energy Fuels can also be used to give us other forms of useful energy. Petrol or diesel is used in cars and trucks to make them go. The stored energy in the fuel is changed into movement energy of the car or truck. Petrol and diesel are made from fossil fuels. Can you see that even energy for cars and generating electricity comes from the sun? Sun Plants and animals Fossil fuels Petrol and diesel Movement energy of car Energy from the sun is stored in the plants and animals that eat the plants. Their remains turned into fossil fuels over millions of years, which are then mined and used to make petrol and diesel to fuel cars. Putting petrol into a car at a petrol station.

AIM: To determine which fuel contains the most amount of energy. MATERIALS AND APPARATUS: • Cork • Needle • Peanuts (other fuels such as a piece of wood, candle wax or piece of biscuit) • Large metal can (coffee tin) • Small metal can (soup can) with paper label removed • Can opener • Hammer • Large nail • Metal spike longer than the diameter of large can • 150 ml of water • Thermometer • Lighter NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1702018/05/18 10:32:26 AM 171Chapter 10: Stored energy in fuels171 METHOD: 1. Carefully push the eye of the needle into the smaller end of the cork. Then gently push the pointed end of the needle into a peanut. If the peanut breaks use another peanut. Peanut Needle Cork Set up your peanut and cork like this. 2. Remove both ends of the large can. Watch out for sharp edges. 3. Use the hammer and nail to make holes all around the bottom of the large can. These are air holes. 4. Punch two holes near the top of the small can exactly opposite each other. 5. Slide the metal spike through the two holes in the small can. 6. Pour 150 ml of water into the small can. 7. Use the thermometer to measure the temperature of the water. Record it in the results table on page 172 in your workbook. 8. Put the cork and peanut on a surface that cannot burn. Use the lighter to light the peanut. The peanut can be difficult to light so keep trying. It will eventually start burning. 9. As soon as the peanut is burning, carefully place the large can over the peanut. Balance the small can inside the big can as shown in the diagram on page 172. The small can must be a short distance above the peanut.

QUESTIONS: 1. Which fuel contained the most amount of energy and how did you determine this? 2. Where did the energy in the peanut originally come from? 3. Discuss what happened to the energy stored in the nut, or other fuels you used. 4. What was the input energy needed to make the peanut (and other fuels) burn? 5. What was the output energy obtained from the fuel? 6. Discuss how you could compare the amount of energy stored in a peanut to the amount of energy stored in a cashew nut. In order to light the fuel, you had to put in a small amount of energy. The fuel however gave out a lot more energy than what was put in. The difference between the energy you put in and the energy the fuel gave out is how much energy was stored in the fuel. The output energy obtained from a fuel is greater than the input energy needed to make the fuel burn. 10.2 Burning fuels We have learnt that burning fuels provides us with energy that we can use. What does a fuel need to be able to burn? Burning fuel requires some energy to start burning. Fuel needs oxygen to burn. Fuel usually gets oxygen from the air around it. There are other gases present in air as well, but they do not burn. The following pie chart illustrates how much of each type of gas is found in the air around us. (For enrichment only) New words • combustion • nitrogen NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1732018/05/18 10:32:27 AM Energy and change and systems and control174 Other (1%) Oxygen (20%) Nitrogen (79%) Pie chart showing the percentage of gases in the air around us. QUESTIONS How much of the air around us consists of oxygen? When something burns we say it is combusting. So, another word for burning is combustion. So, what happens to a flame when we take one of these things away, such as oxygen? When we take something away, we say we deprive it. Let’s find out what happens when a flame is deprived of oxygen! INVESTIGATION 10.2: Deprive a flame of oxygen AIM: To find out how long a candle will burn when given different amounts of oxygen. MATERIALS AND APPARATUS: • Candle • Four glass bottles or jars (small, medium, large and extra large) • Matches • Flat-bottomed bowl Visit The science of fireworks (video). goo.gl/d4HJj NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1742018/05/18 10:32:27 AM 175Chapter 10: Stored energy in fuels175 METHOD: 1. Light the candle. 2. Drip some wax in the middle of the bowl and ‘mount’ a candle in the wax. 3. Pour a small amount of water in the bowl around the candle for the glass jars to stand in. 4. When the candle is securely standing upright, light the candle with the matches. 5. Place the small bottle over the candle and time how long it takes until the candle goes out. Record the time taken in the results table below. Cover the candle as shown with each of the different sized bottles. 6. Repeat the experiment with each of the different sized glass containers and record the time taken for the candle to go out.

In which glass jar did the candle last the longest? 2. In which glass jar did the candle burn out the fastest? CONCLUSION: Write a conclusion for the investigation. QUESTIONS: 1. When lighting a candle, identify the heat source that provides the starting energy and the fuel supply. 2. Why did the candle go out once you put the glass jar over the candle? 3. Why do you think there is a difference in the time taken for the candle to go out? 4. A candle that is allowed to burn freely in air will eventually burn down and go out. Why does the candle stop burning in this situation? What we have learned is that if you take away the fuel or the oxygen, burning will stop. For combustion to be possible, a heat source, fuel and oxygen are needed. Without one of the three, combustion will not happen. You can remember this using the Fire Triangle. All three sides of the triangle are required for combustion.

Because carbon dioxide is toxic if it is inhaled over a long period it can cause death. Another threat is that of open flame.To prevent this, coal burning braziers should be used in a well-ventilated room. Make sure that all the windows and the doors are opened and never sleep near the brazier. Threats of illegal connections Illegal electricity connection can pose great risk as it overloads the system, which often causes the power connection to trip or fail, meaning no one in the area would have electricity. It can also cause a fire. Illegal connections can also cause electrocution, because such connections are usually unsafely constructed and don’t have the required electrical protection. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1782018/05/18 10:32:28 AM 179Chapter 10: Stored energy in fuels179 There are a few safety rules that everybody should know: 1. Never play with matches and lighters. Make sure that matches and lighters are kept out of reach of young children who do not know how to use them properly. 2. In case of fire – stay away. If there is a fire in your home, do not hide, rather go outside as soon as possible. 3. Know the number of the local fire department and phone in case of emergency. 4. Have an escape plan for your home and practise it with your family. Have a meeting place outside so that you will know everyone is safe in the event of a fire.

Batteries are needed for many different purposes. Most torches, radios, watches, cell phones, some toys and even cars, pacemakers and hearing aids need a battery to work. Typical batteries Batteries are useful as they store chemical energy. When the battery is connected in an electrical appliance and it is turned on, the stored energy in the battery is changed into electrical energy, which is used to make the appliance work.

Bring an old torch to school that can be taken apart. Look carefully at all the parts that make up a torch and make a list of what you find. Each part of the torch is needed for it to work properly. When the electrical energy is transferred to where it is needed, then we say that we have a circuit. A circuit is a system and consists of different parts. Chemical energy in the battery in the torch is changed into electrical energy, which is changed into light.

One cell stores a small amount of energy. If we need to store a lot of energy we use a battery. A car needs energy to start its engine. One cell does not have enough stored energy. A car battery is actually six cells that are connected end to end inside the battery case. There is six times more energy stored in the battery than in a single cell. This gives the car enough energy to start the engine. A car battery contains 6 cells. Mmm...so a torch needs two batteries to light up. I wonder how many batteries are needed to light up our house?!

But our homes, schools, shops and factories cannot run on batteries. Electricity does a lot of work for us and is used many times every day. The main source of electrical energy is from power stations. We call this ‘mains electricity’. Power station Power stations need a source of energy Power stations use different ways to generate electricity. A power station needs a source of energy. In South Africa, most of our power stations burn vast amounts of coal to use the energy stored in coal to generate electricity. QUESTIONS Coal is not the only source of energy for power stations, there are also other types of power stations. Find out what these are and write down what source of energy they each use. Electricity is transferred in a huge circuit to our homes From a power station, electricity is transferred through transmission lines held up by pylons. The transmission lines are part of the circuit that connects the power stations to where we need to use the electricity.

Remember they are made from triangular shapes and struts to make them strong and stable! Huge pylons carrying the transmission lines across the country. The transmission lines carry large amounts of electricity to substations in cities and towns. From a substation, the electricity is carried in smaller amounts to electricity boxes for our homes. From the electricity box, electricity travels through wires to the plug points and light fittings in your home.

Copy the diagram and continue it by drawing the path of electricity once it is in your home, and goes through the wires, wall socket and plug to get to an appliance, such as the TV. 11.3 Safety with electricity We use electricity every day. Electricity can be dangerous, so it is important that we use it safely. Electricity can give you an electric shock. An electric shock can hurt you badly or even kill you. Electricity can cause fires and injuries, even death. Here are some rules for using electricity safely: • Do not put anything into an outlet except a plug. • Do not pull on the cord to unplug an appliance, hold the plug and pull. • Dry your hands before you plug in or unplug a cord. • If a plug is broken or a cord is cut or worn, do not use it. • Do not plug too many cords into one outlet. • Keep appliances away from water. Do not use a hair dryer if there is water nearby. • If there is an electrical storm (with lightning), turn off and disconnect electrical appliances, like the TV and computer. • Never touch any power lines. • Some power lines are buried underground. If you are digging and find a power line, do not touch it. • Do not fly a kite or climb a tree near a power line.

Do you remember in Grade 4 when we looked at energy and movement in a system? We were mostly looking at musical instruments and how they use movement energy (the input) such as plucking or blowing, to make them work. In this chapter we are going to look at some other ways of using stored energy to produce movement energy. 12.1 Elastics Stretching an elastic band QUESTIONS Have you ever stretched an elastic band? When you pull it apart and then release it what happens? New words • catapult • stretch • compress • potential energy NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1952018/05/18 10:32:32 AM Energy and change and systems and control196 Wow, I wonder how far I could shoot an elastic? When we stretch an elastic band, we store energy in it. This is because when the band is stretched it can do work when you release it. We are going to look at some other ways of using stretched elastic bands to do work and produce movement. ACTIVITY 12.1: Making your own catapult MATERIALS: • Ten ice lolly sticks or craft sticks • Four to six rubber bands • Plastic spoon • Bag of marshmallows INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Place eight of the sticks together and tie a rubber band tightly around one end. 2. Tie another elastic band around the other end so that the sticks are bound tightly. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1962018/05/18 10:32:33 AM 197Chapter 12: Energy and movement197 3. Tie a rubber band around the remaining two sticks, close to the one end. 4. Insert the bundle of eight sticks bound together through the two stick bundle like this: 5. Tie another rubber band in a cross so that the two bundles are held in place, as shown below: 6. Use a rubber band to secure the plastic spoon on the end. You now have a simple catapult. 7. Shoot the marshmallows by placing one on the spoon, pulling down and then releasing it. 8. Have a competition – who can shoot marshmallows the furthest and most accurately? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1972018/05/18 10:32:33 AM Energy and change and systems and control198 QUESTIONS: 1. How are you able to shoot a marshmallow closer or further away? 2. When the marshmallow goes as far as possible, how much did the elastic band stretch compared to when the marshmallow did not go far? 3. Where did the movement energy of the marshmallow come from? We saw in this activity that if you stretch an elastic band, you can produce movement. The stored energy in the band when it is stretched has the potential to do work. We call the stored energy in the elastic band potential energy because it has the potential to do something for us later. But what does the word ‘potential’ mean? QUESTIONS Look up a definition for potential in your dictionary. A stretched elastic band can also produce movement and do work in the future when it is released. Let’s look at another way of using an elastic band to produce movement energy. We are not going to stretch, but rather twist the elastic band. ACTIVITY 12.2: Build an elastic powered boat MATERIALS: • Rectangular wooden block (about 5 cm by 8 cm by 2 cm) • Two popsicle sticks • Piece of plastic cut from a plastic coffee tin lid (6 cm by 2,5 cm) • Thick rubber band • Thin rubber band • Tub of water to test your boat in NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1982018/05/18 10:32:33 AM 199Chapter 12: Energy and movement199 INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Secure the popsicle sticks flat against the sides of the wooden block with the thick rubber band, so that about a quarter to half of each stick is extending out beyond the end of the block. Popsicle stick Thick rubber band Block of wood 2. Place the thinner rubber band across the ends of the sticks. Thin rubber band 3. Slip the piece of plastic through the thin rubber band. Turn the plastic to twist the rubber band. 4. Place it in the water, and let it go. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 1992018/05/18 10:32:34 AM Energy and change and systems and control200 5. Challenge: Can you get your boat to move backwards and forwards? QUESTIONS: 1. What is the purpose of twisting the elastic band? 2. Why does the boat go? 3. How could you make the boat go in different directions (backwards and forwards)? 4. Write down what you have learnt from the last two activities that you have completed. 12.2 Springs We have been looking at elastic bands and how they can be stretched or twisted to store energy to do work (to produce movement). Springs can also be compressed or stretched to store energy. A slinky is a metal coiled spring. When you stretch a slinky spring it stores energy. When the spring is released, the stored energy is changed into movement energy as it springs back into place. Springs can also be compressed to do work. To compress something means that you squash it. Look at the photo on page 201 of a child jumping on a pogo stick. This pogo stick works using a compressed spring. A slinky is a spring. 1 Visit Slow motion slinky spring (video). goo.gl/FwlFL NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2002018/05/18 10:32:34 AM 201Chapter 12: Energy and movement201 This spring was stretched and Jumping on a pogo stick. 3 when released it moves back. 2 QUESTIONS Use your knowledge of springs to explain how a pogo stick works. Your answer must include the words compress, stored energy and movement. KEY CONCEPTS • Stored energy can be changed into movement energy. • Energy can be stored in a stretched or twisted elastic. • Energy can be stored in compressed or stretched springs.

Have you ever looked underneath a car? It looks very complicated and there are all sorts of pieces and parts, each with their own job to do. We are going to focus on two of the main parts in a vehicle that allow it to move. 13.1 Wheels and axles All vehicles have wheels. Most cars have four wheels, but some have a lot more, while other cars have only three wheels. Trucks and buses have many wheels, while some trailers or bicycles only have two wheels. QUESTIONS Why do you think wheels are round? Why will a square or a triangular wheel not work? How did wheels and axles develop? In the past, before the wheel was invented, it was very difficult to move things around. People would try to drag heavy things along the ground using ropes, or else they had to carry things. But this was very inefficient! So people started to experiment with ways of making it easier to transport goods and heavy objects. The pyramids in Egypt were built long before trucks and modern transport were invented. New words • axle • diameter • bearing NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2032018/05/18 10:32:34 AM Energy and change and systems and control204 The pyramids are very high structures made of stone. 1 The Egyptians were very clever in finding ways to move very heavy objects. They used logs that were laid down. The heavy objects were placed on them, rolling them creating movement like in the picture below. Egyptians pulling heavy stone blocks along logs. The Egyptians used this method to move the massive blocks of stone to build their pyramids. But, there were still many problems with using logs cut from trees. QUESTIONS Can you think of some of the problems of using logs to try to move very heavy objects? Discuss with your friends around you and write your answers below. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2042018/05/18 10:32:35 AM 205Chapter 13: Systems for moving things205 Later on, people then started to cut the logs into short pieces so that they were the same size. It was like a wooden disc. But the wooden disc could not stand up by itself so people attached a wooden pole between two of the wooden discs. This was the axle that is still used nowadays. This is how the first wheel and axle were developed! People could then balance goods on the axle and use this simple machine to pull or push objects along. But this wheel was still very heavy! To make it lighter, the wheel was changed to a round frame with spokes, like a wagon wheel. This made it much lighter and easier to move. Since then, the wheel has advanced a lot. Think of the shiny metal and rubber wheels you see on cars today! A wagon wheel and the modern rubber and metal-rimmed wheels we have today. How do wheels and axles help us? A wheel and axle is a simple machine. A machine is used to make it easier to move a load. It is much easier to move a heavy bag on a wheelbarrow than to carry it by hand. Did you know? The first inflatable tire was made of leather. Today they are made from rubber. Visit Wheels and axles (video). goo.gl/LAvza Did you know? The earliest record of a wheelbarrow comes from China in the Three Kingdoms period (AD 184–280). NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2052018/05/18 10:32:35 AM Energy and change and systems and control206 A wheel and axle is made up of two wheels (large cylinder) joined onto an axle (which is a small cylinder). QUESTIONS Use the diagram to label wheels and axles. Your teacher will provide you with a copy of the diagram. Wheels and axle 2 When we think of wheels and axles, we think of cars and other vehicles that we see all around us that have wheels. A wagon wheel and axle. 3 However, there are many examples of machines that use wheels and axles: 1. rolling pin 2. windmill 3. fan 4. egg beater 5. door knob 6. bicycle wheels NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2062018/05/18 10:32:35 AM 207Chapter 13: Systems for moving things207 ACTIVITY 13.1: What do all wheels and axles share in common? 1. Find pictures of three of the examples on page 206. Look in old magazines and newspapers at home, or on the internet for pictures. Paste the pictures in your exercise books and label the axle and the wheel in each picture. 2. Explain carefully how a door knob is a wheel and axle machine. Let’s make a simple wheel and axle mechanism to understand how it works. ACTIVITY 13.2: A simple wheel and axle machine MATERIALS: • Two chairs • Broom handle • String • Bucket with handle • Masking tape • Scissors • Ruler INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Place the chairs back to back, about 30 cm apart. Rest the broom handle across the back of the chairs. 2. Tie a 50 cm length of string to the bucket handle. 3. Tape the free end of the string to the middle of the broom handle. 4. Place a few marbles or some other light objects in the bucket. 5. Turn the broom handle with your hands to raise the bucket into the air. Turn it back the other way to return the bucket to the ground. 6. Tape the ruler straight up and down the broom handle near one end. 7. Use the ruler, which acts as a wheel, to turn the broom handle and lift the bucket.

Was it easier to lift the bucket when you turned the broom handle using the ruler? 3. Replace the ruler with a stick that is longer than the ruler and use the stick to turn the broom. Was it easier to lift the bucket using the long stick? 4. Identify the axle in the setup. 5. Identify the wheel in the setup. 6. Write a conclusion to summarise what you learnt in this activity. Now, let’s put two axles and four wheels together to make a simple wagon! ACTIVITY 13.3: Making a wagon with wheels and axles MATERIALS: • Cardboard • Two pencils • Small box • Scissors INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Cut out four circles of the same size from the cardboard. You can use a lid from a bottle or a cup to trace around to get circles that are all the same. 2. Make a whole in the centre of each circle and in the bottom four corners of your box. a. To find the centre of the wheel draw diameter lines across the middle. b. A diameter line is the longest straight line you can draw across a circle. Where diameters cross, that is the centre. 3. Push a pencil through the middle of one circle and through a corner of the box. 4. Push the pencil through to the other hole on the other side of the box. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2082018/05/18 10:32:35 AM 209Chapter 13: Systems for moving things209 A wheel is a circle. Find the centre by drawing some diameters. In this example the centre is the red dot. 5. Then attach another circle on the end of the pencil poking out of the side of the box. 6. Repeat this for the other two wheels. 7. You now have a simple wagon like in the picture below. 8. Put an object in the box and push your vehicle along the floor. QUESTIONS: 1. Can you see the wheels turning on the axles and how the axles connect the wheels? 2. Which part of the vehicle that you made is the axle? Different ways to make wheels and axles We are now going to experiment with different ways of making wheels and axles, and finding out the best materials to use. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2092018/05/18 10:32:35 AM Energy and change and systems and control210 There are two ways to let wheels turn on an axle. One way is to have the axle fixed to the body, and the wheels are free to turn on the axle. The other way is to have the wheels fixed to the axle and the axle turns in a bigger tube called the bearing. The bearing is the hollow tube that the axle goes through. The bearing must be bigger than the axle so that the axle can turn easily. You can use plastic straws or the barrel of an old ball- point pen to make a bearing for an axle. The picture shows you two ways to fix the bearings onto the body. Glue Tape Straws are wider than the body to stop wheels rubbing against the body Two ways to fix the bearing onto the body. QUESTIONS What are the two ways used in the picture above to fix the bearing onto the body? What are some materials that you could use to make the axle in the picture? You can also use plastic advertising-board or strong corrugated cardboard to make a body with wheels. Can you see how the axle goes through the holes in the cardboard? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2102018/05/18 10:32:36 AM 211Chapter 13: Systems for moving things211 Corrugated cardboard Dowel stick or stiff wire The board makes bearings for the axles which are fixed to the wheels. The axles turn in the holes. The next picture shows you the other way to let the wheels turn. This time the axle remains still and the wheels turn on the axle. The axle is fastened to a wooden body with cable clips. Cable clips fasten telephone cables to walls. Can you see the blown up version of a cable clip? The clips may hold the axle tightly, so the wheels must be free to rotate. How the cable clips can hold an axle. A clip to hold telephone cables to the wall.

Attach the setup to the small box to test the wheels and axles. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2122018/05/18 10:32:37 AM 213Chapter 13: Systems for moving things213 3. Remember what you learned about how to attach axles to the box and experiment with these different methods as well. (Hint: Bearings!) 4. Experiment with different sized wheels and find the best option. Test and evaluate the different setups you have made to see whether they move easily. 5. Select the best option and make an improved wagon from the one you made in Activity 13.3 with the pencils. 6. Evaluate how far your improved wagon can go if you give it a push with an object in the small box. QUESTIONS: 1. Do a drawing of your final design for your improved wagon in your exercise books. Remember to label the different materials that you used. 2. What did you decide was the best material to use for the wheels and why? 3. What did you decide to use for the axles and why? 4. How did you attach the wheels to the axle in your final design? 5. How far could your wagon go after you gave it a push and it was carrying an object? 6. How would you improve your design if you had to do it again?

The Earth orbits the sun and the Earth also spins on its own axis. Let’s revise these concepts again. The Earth spins to give us day and night In Grade 4 you learned that the Earth spins on its axis. But what does this mean? Imagine an orange with a pencil stuck through it. Look at the picture. If you hold the pencil in your fingers, you can spin the orange around. The pencil is the axis of the orange. The Earth does not really have a pencil through it, but it does spin around. We can imagine a big pencil through the middle of the Earth. The Earth is like the orange and the pencil is like the axis. The curved arrows show which way the Earth spins. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2182018/05/18 10:32:40 AM 219Chapter 14: Planet Earth219 We are on the Earth. Let us imagine we are at the point where you see the red ‘X’ on the orange on the previous page: • The sun shines on the Earth and so we, at X, see the sun. We call that day-time. • But the Earth never stops spinning. So we, at X, move around into the shaded part of the Earth. Then we cannot see the sun any longer and it is night-time for us at X. • The Earth spins right around in 24 hours, so it will take 24 hours for us to come around to the same position you see in the picture. • We call the 24 hours a day. When we say ‘a day’ we really mean a day-and-night. Together they last 24 hours. If we are at position X, we move past the sun. But to us, it looks as if the sun is moving. The sun seems to move from the east to the west. In the east it rises (comes up), goes across the sky at lunch-time and moves to the west where it sets (goes down). But the sun does not actually move. North pole South pole The Earth has an axis from the north to the south pole.

Turn further to your left and you will see the sun ‘rise’ over your left cheek. That is like sunrise in Africa. QUESTIONS: 1. Which of your cheeks is like the west? That is where the sun appear to go down. 2. Which cheek is like the east, where the sun appears to come up? We see the sun rise and move across the sky every day. But the sun does not really move – it only seems to move. Earth is spinning round and round, and we are moving around with the Earth. The Earth takes 24 hours to complete one full rotation. Sun Earth Light rays DayNight Can you see how the light from the sun only reaches one half of the Earth as it rotates? The Earth moves in an orbit around the sun The Earth moves around the sun. The Earth moves around the sun while it is spinning. It spins round 365 times while it completes one orbit of the sun. That means 365 days pass and we call that a year. The Earth is called a planet. There are seven other planets also moving around the sun. You can see one of the other planets on most evenings, or early in the morning. This planet is called Venus or iKhwezi or Naledi ya Masa. It is not a star. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2232018/05/18 10:32:41 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control224 You can see the planet Venus just after sunset or just before sunrise below the moon. Venus also moves around the sun but its orbit is a smaller circle than Earth’s orbit. Venus takes 225 Earth days to go once around the sun. Mars is another planet you can see on some nights. Mars appears as a small, orange dot in the sky. Mars takes 687 Earth days to go once around the sun. You can also see Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn in the sky, but they are harder to see than Venus and Mars. All the planets seem to move along the same path that the sun and moon seem to move. The planets move in orbits around the sun. The orbits lie on the same plane, as if they were on a big flat plate.

But, if we tried to draw the orbits to scale, they definitely would not fit on this page! Let’s make a scale model of the solar system using our bodies to understand what it means to orbit the sun! My model of the solar system is not to scale. If we want to make one to scale, we will need a really big area! ACTIVITY 14.3: Making a scale model of the solar system MATERIALS: • 100 m heavy string • Nine pieces of heavy cardboard • Scissors • Permanent marker INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Learners are divided up into eight groups and each group is assigned a planet. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2252018/05/18 10:32:42 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control226 2. Each group must cut a piece of string to represent the distance of their planet from the sun, using the lengths indicated in the table on page 226. The actual distance of the planets from the sun is given in gigametres (Gm) and the length of the string is in metres (m). One gigametre is one million kilometres, which is 1 000 000 000 metres.

Each group must cut a circle out of the cardboard and write the name of their planet and the actual distance from the sun on it. 4. Make a hole at one edge of the cardboard and tie the length of string to it. 5. Now it is time to go outside to a big open space, like the school field! 6. Your teacher will be the sun in the centre. She/he does not move as the sun does not move. 7. One member from each group must hand the ‘sun’ the end of their length of string and then stretch out their length of string. 8. Do this one at a time starting from Mercury and going out to Neptune. You do not all need to be in a straight line but can be in different positions around the ‘sun’. 9. Place the strings on the ground, all stretched out in different directions. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2262018/05/18 10:32:42 AM 227Chapter 14: Planet Earth227 10. Walk around so that you can all see the scale model of the solar system. 11. Now comes the tricky part – making the planets orbit the sun. 12. Select one learner from each group to be the planet. 13. He/she must pick up the planet and walk in a circle around your teacher, all going in the same direction. Try and walk at the same speed. 14. Swop with other learners in your group so that you each have a turn to be a planet orbiting the sun. KEY CONCEPTS • The Earth spins on its axis. This is the reason we have day and night. • The Earth also moves through space, around the sun. • The Earth’s path through space around the sun is called its orbit.

QUESTIONS Look at the photo of the Earth on page 220. What is on the surface of the Earth? Name all the features (parts) you can think of. What do you think is under the surface? ACTIVITY 15.1: Digging a hole in the Earth Look at the picture of a digging machine on page 230 and imagine you are driving it. QUESTIONS: 1. What is under the floor of this classroom? 2. Imagine that you use the machine to dig as deep as you want. You drive it down into the Earth. What do you find as you go down? 3. Do a drawing of yourself, the digging machine and the hole. In your drawing, show (a) the Earth (b) the digging machine with you inside (c) the hole (d) what you find at the deepest part of the hole. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2292018/05/18 10:32:43 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control230 Imagine that you have a powerful digging machine. So what do we find as we dig deeper? When we begin to dig, we first dig though topsoil. Good topsoil is usually a dark colour. Topsoil is very important for life. As you can see in the picture on page 231, plants and animals depend on topsoil. If we dig deeper, we find subsoil. This layer is often sandy and orange in colour. When we dig deeper, we come to rock. This layer of rock underneath the soil is called bedrock. Did you know? Geomorphology is the study of the Earth’s surface features. New words • topsoil • subsoil • bedrock • humus • crust • mantle • core • cross-section NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2302018/05/18 10:32:44 AM 231Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth231 Look at the illustration below and find the topsoil. Find the subsoil underneath the topsoil and the bedrock at the bottom. Humus Topsoil Subsoil Weathered rock fragments Bedrock Topsoil is usually darker than the Plants and animals depend on topsoil. soil underneath. When we dig through the bedrock, a few hundred metres deep, we may find different layers of rock. We may even find water in cracks in the rock in some places. We may find coal in a few places. Deeper down, about a kilometre deep, we may find oil and gas. Still deeper, we will find very hard rock and the rock will feel hot to touch. In Gauteng and the Free State, in a very few places, we will find rock that has gold in it. Look at the picture on page 232. Can you see a hand cutting a slice out of the Earth? Did you know? The deepest mines in the world are in South Africa, in Gauteng. Those mines are 4 km deep and the miners are digging deeper every month. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2312018/05/18 10:32:45 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control232 South Africa Imagine we could cut a slice out of the Earth. In the next picture you see what the Earth is like inside. South Africa Antarctica The crust may be 10 km thick under an ocean, but up to 70 km thick under a continent. Crust MantleCore 2 900 km3 500 km If we cut the slice out of the Earth, the Earth could look like this inside. The land is made up of rocks, subsoil and topsoil.

We are in rock that is called the crust of the Earth. The crust is the outer layer of the Earth’s surface. Find the crust in the previous picture. The crust consists of rock and soil. The crust is about 70 km thick, so we have not gone very far yet. Humans have only gone 5 km deep, and the hole that they excavated is so small that you cannot see it in the crust. Miners in the deep gold mines suffer from heat. The deeper they go, the hotter the rock is. 1 Does the crust go under the sea also? Look at the picture of the rocks and sea below. This is where the ocean meets the land. Does the land go under the ocean? 2 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2332018/05/18 10:32:45 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control234 QUESTIONS If you dig a hole in the beach sand what will you find if you dig very deep? If you went down under the sea water, what would you find down there? The sea is very deep if you go far from the beach. The sea may be kilometres deep. The deepest part of the sea is called the Marianas Trench. It is near the Marianas Islands, south of Japan. You can find this place on the classroom globe or a map. It is a trench (like a valley with steep sides) that is 11 km deep. The sun’s light cannot reach down to the bottom and it is pitch-dark. The water presses down with a pressure that is like the weight of three buses pressing on your thumbnail! Three scientists have gone down there in small submarines, and taken pictures and collected rocks. The submarines had bright lights, and the scientists were amazed when they saw animals that live down there. You can see an animal called an anemone in the picture. The people in the submarines saw anemones like this in the deepest part of the ocean. 3 They found rocks that look like those in the photograph. So the crust rock lies under the oceans as well as under our feet. The crust is a layer of rock all around the Earth, like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2342018/05/18 10:32:45 AM 235Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth235 It must be such an interesting world in the depths of the oceans. I wonder what it is like? Soil, air, water and sunlight support life on Earth Life on Earth exists on the very thin layer around the planet – the crust. The soil is a thin layer and all the plants need soil to grow in. The plants use energy from the sun to grow, and they make the oxygen we and all the animals need to breathe. You already learnt about this in Life and Living. ACTIVITY 15.2: Thinking about the layers of the Earth (For enrichment only) QUESTIONS: 1. What is the diameter of the Earth? 2. The Earth is really a ball, so how deep can the hole be? 3. If the digging machine went as far as it can go, what is the last layer of the Earth that it would dig through? 4. Which is the best model of the Earth – a loaf of bread, an apple or an avocado? Look at the three pictures on page 236. Which of those is most like the Earth? Explain your answer. Remember that the Earth has a hard crust, a hot sticky mantle and a hot core. 5. Although the model you chose is most like the Earth, it is not exactly the same. In what way is this model not like the Earth?

Soil comes from rocks Rocks do not last for ever! They may seem very hard and indestructible, but let’s have a look. ACTIVITY 15.3: Can hard things like rock and stone wear away? Stones are hard. People say that a thing that is made of stone will last for ever. But is this true? MATERIALS: • Two stones (pieces of rock) • Sheet of paper Rubbing rocks together to make sand. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2362018/05/18 10:32:46 AM 237Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth237 INSTRUCTIONS 1. Find a cement step that everyone at the school walks on. Sweep the step clean and then look carefully at the step. Why are these steps wearing away? 2. Can you see where people put their feet? What has happened there? 3. Find a piece of cement under an outside tap. Look carefully at the cement, where the water falls on it. You might see that the cement is rougher just where the water hits it. The cement has lost little pieces. 4. Find out how long the cement has been there. Perhaps it was put in when the school was built. So how many years did it take to wear away (weather) the cement? 5. Find another object that is being worn away. Tomorrow, tell the class about what you have found. New words • expand • contract • weathering • soil • microogranism • erosion Look at the place where the water hits the cement. How is the cement changing? The place where the water hits the cement NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2372018/05/18 10:32:47 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control238 6. What do you think is wearing away the object? 7. When a small bit breaks off the object, where do you think it goes? 8. Are the small bits still lying somewhere, do you think? 9. Now rub the two rocks together for three minutes. Let all the little pieces fall onto the paper. In nature, rocks turn into sand. But how does it happen? Big rocks break up into smaller rocks We know that we can break big stones into small stones. But when we see small stones lying on the ground, it is hard to think how they were broken up. In nature, rocks break up in many ways. We will look at just three of those ways. 1. Bigger rocks break up into smaller rocks Over time, rocks can get cracks in the surface. Water gets into the cracks and causes the cracks to get bigger. Pieces of rock then break off when the cracks get bigger. Smaller and smaller pieces of rock form as the rocks break up more and more. This rock cracked and broke to form two smaller rocks. 2. Water breaks up the surface of rocks In the soil, we can find a little water. The roots of plants can change this water so that the water becomes an acid. Vinegar has acid in it, and that is why vinegar tastes so sour. Did you know? The volcanic rock known as pumice is the only rock that can float in water. Visit Rocks erode to form soil (video). goo.gl/6Rd6D NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2382018/05/18 10:32:47 AM 239Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth239 Acid can work on stones to break them up. The acid water breaks the surface of the stone and then the stone can break more easily. Rain water can also break up and wear down the surface of stones, causing small pieces to break off. We saw an example of this with the water from the tap breaking up the cement. Rain wears down rocks and causes smaller pieces to break off. 3. Stones rub together, and their surfaces break up Stones rub together when water moves them, or when wind blows them against bigger stones. People and animals walking on a path kick stones and break off little pieces. Small stones become even smaller, and the small pieces become sand. People and animals break stones into smaller stones when they walk over them. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2392018/05/18 10:32:47 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control240 The constant impact from heavy tractors driving through will break larger rocks up into smaller pieces. 4 The roots of plants also cause stones in the soil to rub together and break up into smaller pieces. In real soil this change takes many years. We can make it happen in the classroom in a week. Look at the diagram on page 241. ACTIVITY 15.4: Make a model of acid water breaking up rocks MATERIALS: • Cement brick (not the shiny dark red or orange bricks) • Large plastic container (bottom half of a plastic cooldrink bottle) • Bottle of white vinegar NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2402018/05/18 10:32:48 AM 241Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth241 Jar cut from 2 litre cooldrink bottle Cement Vinegar Vinegar acid is working in on the surface of the cement brick. Parts of the brick are falling off. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Put the cement brick into the container. 2. Pour enough of the vinegar into the plastic container to cover half of the brick. 3. Put the container in a place where everyone can observe it every day for two weeks. 4. Cover the container and make sure the mixture does not evaporate and leave the brick dry. QUESTIONS: 1. Draw the brick as it looks on day 1. 2. Draw the brick as it looks on day 14. 3. What changes have happened to the brick? 4. Has the part of the brick that is above the vinegar changed in the same way as the part that is below the vinegar? 5. Have any parts of the brick fallen off and sunk to the bottom of the container? 6. Write out the sentences in your workbook and complete them with some of the words from the word box: NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2412018/05/18 10:32:48 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control242 This equipment is a model of rock, not the real rock. The brick a real rock and the vinegar acid water around the roots of plants. • represents • represents the real Making soil Rocks break down and slowly change into sand. This change needs thousands of years to take place because soil, wind and water do it very slowly. But sand is not soil. More changes must happen to sand before it can be soil. ACTIVITY 15.5: Look at different kinds of soil MATERIALS: • Tin-can half full of moist topsoil (moist means it is not dry) • Magnifying glass • Sheet of white paper • Toothpicks, matches or pieces of dried grass (for moving little pieces of soil) INSTRUCTIONS 1. Smell the soil in the tin. Does it have a smell? 2. Put a teaspoonful of the topsoil on the white paper and spread it out. 3. Use your stick to move the small bits of soil that you find there. Look at the soil with the magnifier. Make piles of bits that look the same. • One pile will be rock grains. You will find very small pieces of rock and some pieces that are not so small. There will also be some grains that are almost too small to see. • Another pile will be small bits of plants. You will find very small pieces of sticks, leaves and roots. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2422018/05/18 10:32:48 AM 243Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth243 • Another pile will be small bits of animals. You will find very small pieces of beetle shell or legs, or wings of flies. • You may even find a small live animal! If you do find one, do a drawing of it on your paper and then let it go on the soil outside. Rock particles Parts of dead animals Parts of dead plants Look closely at the soil. What pieces do you find there? QUESTIONS: 1. What colour is your soil? Use words like “dark brown”, “grey” “orange” or “yellow”. 2. Complete the sentence: Soil has sand but it also has ... 3. Draw some of the grains of rock (sand) that you find. Draw any small bits of plants or bits of dead animals that you see in the soil. Draw any small living animals that you find in the soil. Then let them go outside. We can make soil in a few weeks, but only a small amount of soil. In this activity you begin the slow process of making soil. Your class perhaps started the compost column in the first week of the term. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2432018/05/18 10:32:49 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control244 ACTIVITY 15.6: Begin to make soil MATERIALS: • Three big cooldrink bottles • Old stocking • Strong rubber band • Felt-tip pens that will write on plastic • Big needle and scissors • Tin can • Scraps of vegetables and fruit, leftover porridge, cut grass (enough to fill a big bottle to the top) • Cup of water Air holes Compost mix: bread, eggshells, banana peels, cut grass, old vegetables, old porridge, apple cores String or rubber band Water to pour back Stocking cloth Cut and join the cooldrink bottles together. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Cut the plastic bottles and join them together. 2. Cut a piece of stocking to fit over the neck of the bottle that is upside down. The stocking will stop the vegetable peels falling through the hole, but it will let water go through. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2442018/05/18 10:32:49 AM 245Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth245 3. Add the vegetable peels, old bread, and leaves. 4. Now slowly pour in the cup of water. Let the water go down through the stocking, into the bottom container. 5. Now use the needle to make air holes in the top bottle, as you see in the picture. 6. Mark the height of the compost column on the plastic. Write the date next to the mark. 7. Each Friday, mark the height of the compost column again, and write the date on the bottle. 8. Then take out the bottom container with the water in it, and pour the water into a tin. 9. Then, use the tin to pour all the water slowly back into the compost. This will stop the compost from drying out. 10. Begin a class logbook. A logbook is a book in which you write down what happens on a day. Look at the example below which shows Felicity’s log book from when the Quantum Club did the experiment in their class. This is what you may see in Felicity’s logbook. In the beginning, you might think the compost looks ugly, and is just a lot of rotting food and leaves. It might have a smell. But as the weeks go by, you will see changes in the colour and the size of the small pieces. You will also see some things begin to grow in the compost. The smell will change. You may also see insects appear from the compost. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2452018/05/18 10:32:49 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control246 QUESTIONS: 1. Did you notice any changes in the compost? Did you see anything begin to grow in the compost? 2. What happens to the colour of the water that you pour back in every week? 3. What do you think is in the water? 4. Why must you use the same water each week and not take fresh water? 5. Why does the compost column become lower as the days go by? 6. Where do you think the insects come from? The grey hairy things that you see growing in the vegetable peels are fungi, and they help to break down the peels. There are many kinds of fungi and they have different colours. When you see insects in the compost column, they may be fruit flies that can get in through the air holes, but they may also be hatching from eggs that insects laid in the peels and leaves before you put them into the plastic bottles. Do you remember in the first term when we observed the life cycle of fruit flies in Life and Living? After about four weeks, your compost will be a dark colour and the big pieces will have broken down into small pieces. You can pour out the compost and mix an equal amount of sand with the compost. Now you have made a little soil! Microorganisms in the soil When you looked at soil, you found sand grains, small bits of plants and small bits of animals. But there was another group of things you could not see, because they are too small. They are microorganisms. They are alive and they are busy in the soil, changing dead plant and animal material into substances that plants can use and absorb through their roots. If we work hard, we can make a small amount of good topsoil in a term. But a farmer needs good topsoil all over the farm. Nature works all over the Earth but it works very NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2462018/05/18 10:32:49 AM 247Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth247 slowly. Nature needs about 1 000 years to make topsoil just 10 cm deep. If rain washes away the topsoil, the farmer cannot grow good crops on that land. Look at the photo below. The topsoil has gone from this land, and the farmer can never grow food here again. 5 Even if the farmer stops the erosion, it will be about 1 000 years before nature can make new topsoil to replace the soil that has gone. If there is too little topsoil, then there will be too few plants for animals to eat. So all animals depend on the topsoil, even animals like lions that only eat meat. QUESTIONS We can say that lions depend on topsoil for their food, although they do not eat topsoil. Why do lions depend on the topsoil for their food? Explain your answer. Hint: Think back to what you learned in the first term in Life and Living about food chains. The mantle and the core lie under the crust If we go deeper than the crust, we go into rock called the mantle. The mantle is the layer that lies underneath the crust. Mantle rock is much hotter than the rock that is found in the crust. The rocks are so hot that they are soft This section is for enrichment only. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2472018/05/18 10:32:49 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control248 in some places, like toothpaste. If there is a weak spot in the crust, the hot rock pushes upwards and it might burst out. This is how volcanoes happen. The mantle is 2 900 km thick, so we still have a long way to go down. QUESTIONS Find the mantle in the diagram of the Earth cut open on page 232. How could you get to the mantle? Which way do you have to go? The core is still deeper than the mantle. It is very hot, as hot as the surface of the sun, and made of mostly iron. ACTIVITY 15.7: So what is under our feet? (For enrichment only) INSTRUCTIONS: 1. In Activity 15.1 at the beginning of this chapter you drew pictures of yourself digging a hole into the Earth. You had to imagine you were making the hole as deep as a hole can be. 2. Perhaps you feel your picture is correct, or perhaps you want to change your idea about the Earth. 3. Look at that picture now, and do the activity again. QUESTIONS: 1. If you could make a hole into the Earth, through the floor of your classroom, what would you find down in the Earth? 2. Imagine you have that machine that can dig as deep as you want. You drive this digging machine as far as it can go. What do you find? 3. Do you think the same as you did, when you began this chapter? Have you changed your ideas about the Earth? 4. Use the classroom globe to answer this question: If you dug a hole straight down into the Earth from South Africa, and went through the core of the Earth, where would the hole come out? Draw a picture in your exercise book. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2482018/05/18 10:32:49 AM 249Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth249 15.2 Soil types Have you ever noticed how many different colours of soil and textures of soil there are? Even if you are just walking around your school grounds, you may come across many different types of soil. This is because there are different particles that make up soil. These particles can vary in amounts and therefore make up different types of soils. Some particles are bigger, others are smaller and some are in between. A soil sample normally has a lot of particles either bigger, smaller or in between, and a smaller portion of the other sizes. Soil particles – Sand, silt and clay There are three main types of particles which make up soil: • Clay • Silt • Sand If the soil was formed from a very hard rock, then it has bigger particles, if it was formed from a soft rock then the particles will be smaller. INVESTIGATION 15.1: Different amounts of sand, silt and clay AIM: To find out how much sand, silt and clay there is in soil from two different places. PREDICTION (What you think you will find out): The soil from will have more , and the soil from will have more . New words • sample • clay • loam • silt • funnel • hypothesis NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2492018/05/18 10:32:49 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control250 MATERIALS AND APPARATUS: • Soil from two different places, such as near the top of a slope or hill and near the bottom. Or take soil from under a tree and other soil in an area with wild grass. The soils should look different. • Sheets of newspaper to keep the desks clean • Two large see-through jars the same size. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Collect two tins of soil from the places you chose. These are samples of each kind of soil. (A sample is a little bit to study.) 2. Feel the two samples in your hand. How do they feel different? Do they smell different? 3. Spread a teaspoonful on the white paper and look at each – in what ways do they look different? 4. Then put your soil samples into the glass jars. Pour in water to make the jar almost full, cover the top and shake each jar to mix the soil and water. 5. Now leave the two jars to stand until tomorrow. The water must not move. 6. In the morning you will see something like in the picture on page 251. In each jar, the water has let the large grains settle at the bottom, the very small grains are on top, and the clay grains are so small they are still mixed with the water. You may see some plant parts floating on the water. 7. Your two jars will show different layers. In one jar, you might see a lot of sand, and in the other jar you might see less sand. OBSERVATIONS: Draw the two jars showing the layers in your two sand samples. Give your drawings labels and a heading. How could you do this investigation better? CONCLUSION (What you learnt): The difference between our two soil samples is that ... NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2502018/05/18 10:32:50 AM 251Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth251 Parts of dead animals and plants Water with clay particles Silt Fine sand Coarse sand Gravel (small stones) You will have two jars like this. The parts of your soil will settle in layers. You will see that your soil has some grains that are grains of sand, some grains that are smaller and some that are so small you can’t see them. • Sand, which feels rough and grainy between your fingers. • Silt has much smaller grains but you can still feel that the silt is a bit rough. • Clay has such small grains that when you rub it between your fingers it feels like paint. In fact you can paint with it. When clay dries, it becomes hard. QUESTIONS Can you make pots with sand? What kind of soil is good for making pots? NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2512018/05/18 10:32:50 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control252 Soil types – Sand, clay and loam As we saw previously, different soil samples collected from different places have different size particles. Imagine running along the beach and feeling the sand beneath your feet. Now imagine running through a forest over the soil. Can you see there are big differences in these types of soil? The mixture of particles and the size of particles determines the soil type. There are three different types of soils: • Clay • Loam • Sand Let’s look at the characteristics of the soil types. Sandy soil is the soil you find at the beach. It consists of large gritty particles and very tiny bits of rock, which we call grains of sand. The grains of sand are coarse and the soil is loose. Sandy soil does not retain water. Sandy soil Clay Loam The types of soil NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2522018/05/18 10:32:50 AM 253Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth253 Other characteristics of sandy soil are: it does not retain fertilisers. It is easily washed or blown away. It becomes warm quickly on a sunny day. Plants do not grow well in sandy soil. Sandy soil has lots of coarse grains of sand. 6 QUESTIONS Why do you think plants do not grow well in sandy soil? Have you ever made a pot out of clay? If you are lucky enough to have done this or seen someone do it, you will know a bit about the properties of clay. Clay can be moulded. This is because it consists mainly of very fine particles, which cling together. Clay gets sticky when wet. It retains fertilisers for a very long time. It is difficult for clay to be blown away or washed away. It does not become as warm as sandy soil. Clay soil consists of lots of very fine grains of clay and can be moulded into pots. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2532018/05/18 10:32:50 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control254 QUESTIONS Do you think plants will be able to grow in clay? Loam is a very funny word! But this is also a type of soil. Loam is actually a mixture of clay, sand and humus. Humus is organic material from plants and animals, which is decomposing. Loam is fairly loose and fertile. It retains fertilisers longer than sandy soil. It is not easily blown or washed away. It is much cooler than either sand or clay soil. Loam soil is the best type of soil for plants to grow in! Loam soil is rich with humus. 7 QUESTIONS What are the differences between loam and sandy soil? Name three things that you find in loam but you do not find in sand. Each soil type also has air and water in it, and sometimes the remains of dead organisms and very small living organisms. How do some plants live when no rain falls? We do know that many plants can live through the dry season, even though no rain falls for eight months. How do they do it?

Look at the picture below. 2. Dig a hole in the soil outside, like this. 3. Cover the hole with a sheet of clear plastic and hold it down with some bricks or rocks. 4. After a short time, you will see drops of water on the plastic. Water droplets Dig a hole in the soil, and cover it with a clear plastic sheet. QUESTIONS: 1. Are the drops on the top or the bottom of the plastic? 2. Where is the water coming from? 3. How did the water get into the soil? 4. Some plants can live even when no rain falls. How do they live? Farmers know that soils are not all the same. They know that some soils hold water well, and other soils do not hold water well. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2552018/05/18 10:32:51 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control256 An easy way to see how well soil holds water is to pour some water into soil and let it run through into a bottle. Look at the first picture below. These two bottles are the same size. In the next picture, the water is poured into the jar with the soil in it. Look at the last picture on page 257. Has all the water run through the soil? Put the soil in a funnel, like this. Use two jars of the same size. One with water and one with soil. Soil Cotton wool A In the next picture the water is poured into the jar with soil. Slowly pour the water onto the soil and wait five minutes.

Let us do an investigation to see how much water the different soil types can hold. For this investigation activity you need two different kinds of soil, from two different places. Let us call them Soil A and Soil B. Plan an investigation to compare two types of soil named as Soil A and Soil B, and then do the investigation. The main question you must answer is: Which soil holds more water? INVESTIGATION 15.2: Which soil holds more water? MATERIALS AND APPARATUS: • Soil sample A and B • 4 bottles • Two funnels PROCEDURE: 1. Transfer the same amount of soil (sample A and B) to the funnels. See the figure below: 2. Do not fill the funnel with soil. 3. Pour equal amount of water in each and observe. What will you do to make sure you are being fair?

PREDICTION: What do you think will happen? MATERIALS AND APPARATUS: Look at the pictures above to help you write a list in your exercise book. METHOD: Write out the instructions for how to carry out this investigation. Remember to number the steps. RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS: 1. What did you observe when doing this experiment? 2. Draw a bar graph to show your results from this experiment. Remember to label the axes of your graph and give it a heading. 3. How could you do this investigation better? CONCLUSION: Write a sentence where you give a conclusion about what you learnt from this investigation. See if you can identify what types of soil A and B were. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2582018/05/18 10:32:53 AM 259Chapter 15: Surface of the Earth259 Sandy soil does not hold much water. Clay soil holds too much water. Clay holds water because it has very small grains. The grains fit together tightly. Loam soil has a mixture of sand and clay, along with composted plant and animal substances. So, loam soil holds water well but does not become waterlogged like clay soil. QUESTIONS Why does sand let the water run through quickly? Which soil type do plants grow best in? Now that we have looked at how different soil types hold different amounts of water, let’s compare how well plants grow in the different soil types. In Life and Living, you might have grown seedlings before, but let’s try again and this time focus on the type of soil. INVESTIGATION 15.3: Compare how well plants grow in different kinds of soil AIM: What do you want to find out? PREDICTION: What do you think will happen? MATERIALS AND APPARATUS: • Three large jam tins • Packet of radish seeds or bean seeds or maize seeds • Some sand, enough to fill one tin • Some loam soil, enough to fill a tin (You can find loam soil in a vegetable garden.) • Some clay soil, enough to fill the last tin (if you have access to clay soil) • Ruler • Measuring cup • Tablespoon NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2592018/05/18 10:32:53 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control260 METHOD: 1. Make five small holes in the bottom of each tin, so that water can drain out if there is too much water in the tin. 2. Fill one tin with sand, one tin with the loam soil, and the last tin with clay soil. 3. Plant ten radish seeds in each tin. Cover the seeds by sprinkling a little of the sand or soil over them. 4. Pour a cup of water into each tin. Remember to keep the amount of water constant to make it a fair test. 5. Now let the seeds begin to grow, perhaps on the windowsill in the classroom to make sure that they have a light source. 6. Each day, give each tin a tablespoon of water. 7. Observe the radish seeds growing for a week, and compare them. 8. Measure the height of the radish plants growing in each type of soil. Calculate the average seedling height for each soil type. 9. Record your results in a table. RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS: 1. Use your exercise books to draw a table to record your results from measuring the height of the seedlings each day. Give your table a heading. Average height grown by seedlings in different soil types: DateLoam soil (mm) Sandy soil (mm) Clay soil (mm) 2. Now draw graphs to compare your results. A table is one way of presenting results, but a graph gives a visual representation, which is sometimes easier to quickly understand and compare the results from an experiment. a. First draw a bar graph to show the change in average height of the seedlings grown in loam soil over time.

How did these layers form? We saw in Chapter 15 that the surface of the Earth is made up of rocks and soil. There are different soil types, but did you know that there are also different types of rock? We classify rocks depending on how they were formed. We are only going to look at sedimentary rock in this chapter, and find out how it is formed and used. 16.1 Formation of sedimentary rock In Chapter 15, we saw how rocks break up into smaller and smaller pieces, until we have grains of sand. Now we find out what happens to the sand. First, rocks break up into smaller pieces, until the pieces are grains of sand. Next, wind and moving water carry the sand and mud away. Then, the wind or the water may drop the sand and mud in one place. Finally, the sand grains might get stuck together again over time and make new rock. This new rock is called sedimentary rock. Erosion and deposition When wind or water move the pieces away from the rock, we call this erosion. The wind and water erode the rock as they carry away the sand. Visit Different rock types (video) goo.gl/yD3qd New words • sedimentary rock • sediment • deposition • limestone • shale • chalk • sandstone • new rock • erosion NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2632018/05/18 10:32:54 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control264 A large valley is forming due Soil erosion due to water. 2 to soil erosion. 1 When the wind and water put the sand grains down, we call this deposition. The wind and water deposit the sand. The wind is depositing sand in this corner of the school. Deposition is happening here. Sediments When the sand grains collect on top of each other, they form a sediment. Over time, new layers of of mud and sand are deposited on the previous layers. Over a very long time, these sediments become compacted and hardened, and become sedimentary rock. This happens because the grains of sand become glued together, and other heavy sediments press down on the grains of sand. Sediments lie on top of each other. We can actually see these layers in sedimentary rock and they are sometimes different colours. Find the sediments in the following photos. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2642018/05/18 10:32:54 AM 265Chapter 16: Sedimentary rock265 Sandstone rock in the Layers of limestone Cederberg in the Western Cape. sedimentary rock. 5 Can you see the different Look at these layers in this coloured layers in this sedimentary rock known as sedimentary rock? 3 shale. 4 Let’s have a look at how sediments are deposited over time. Except, we do not have thousands of years so we are going to pretend each day of the week is actually about 1000 years! ACTIVITY 16.1: Depositing sediments MATERIALS: • A large see-through jar (cooldrink bottle) • Different places to collect sand and soil NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2652018/05/18 10:32:54 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control266 INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in groups. Put the jar in a place where everyone can see it. 2. Group 1 must collect a large jam-tin full of sand and on Monday they pour their sand into the jar. 3. Group 2 must collect sand or soil from a different place. On Tuesday, someone from Group 2 pours that sand into the jar. 4. On Wednesday, Group 3 pours in sand or soil from a different place. 5. By Friday, the jar will have different layers. QUESTIONS: 1. Which sand sediment was put in on Tuesday? 2. Which is the oldest sediment? ACTIVITY 16.2: Which sediment is the oldest? People who dig holes in the riverbed to access underground water sometimes see the sand sediments. The Quantum Club decided to dig a hole down in the river bed just outside their school. Look at the picture below where you can see Felicity’s feet standing on the top and the layers of sediment going down below.

Explain why we find its bones under four sediments of sand. d. Work out in what year the bird fell into the mud. 7. What will you find if you dig deeper than sediment 8? Look at the photo below of the Grand Canyon – can you see old sedimentary rock? Look at the sediments of rock. The rock is very hard now. It has been compressed for millions of years. Look at the layers of the sedimentary rock in the Grand Canyon. 6, 7 Did you know? Scientists think the Earth is between four and five billion years old. Did you know? The oldest layers of sedimentary rock visible in the Grand Canyon are believed to be nearly two billion years old. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2672018/05/18 10:32:55 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control268 QUESTIONS Show with your finger which sediment of rock is the oldest. Show where you can find soil, in the picture. Sedimentary rocks are also eroded and broken down into grains of sand again. The sedimentary rock in the Grand Canyon formed a very long time ago. The layers of sediment were once deposited in warm shallow seas and over millions of years they compacted to form rock. The wind and rain have eroded it until it looks like it does in the photo. Look at the diagram below which summarises how sedimentary rock is formed, mostly under the sea or in lakes and rivers. Land Sea Material washed into the sea or blown in by wind Plant and animal material dies Layers of sediment form Over time the bottom layers turn into rock The formation of sedimentary rock QUESTIONS Use the diagram above to write a summary paragraph explaining how sedimentary rock is formed.

Rocks that fell down Valley Top of mountain River This is how the mountain looks now. What did the mountain look like millions of years ago? QUESTIONS: 1. The rock and sand are being removed from the mountains. How does this happen? 2. Where does the rock and sand go? 3. Draw a diagram to show how the mountain might have looked many years ago, before the rock and sand were eroded. Different kinds of sedimentary rock There are many kinds of sedimentary rock. Here are three kinds: 1. Sandstone is made from grains of sand that are cemented together. 2. Shale is made from grains of clay that are cemented together. Shale is quite soft and you can use it to write with, like a piece of chalk. Did you know? Chalk is a soft, white form of limestone. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2692018/05/18 10:32:55 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control270 3. Limestone is made of layers of shells of sea animals that died and sank to the bottom of the sea. Other kinds of limestone are made from sea water evaporating. 16.2 Uses of sedimentary rock You just saw that there are different types of sedimentary rocks. These rock types are used in different ways. Limestone Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock and it has many uses, mostly as building materials. Limestone is cut into blocks and used in buildings. Look at these photos below of different buildings made from limestone. Can you see the blocks of The city hall in Cape Town is limestone in this building? 8 built with limestone. Limestone is crushed and used to make cement. Limestone is often used in sculptures, as it can be carved easily.

Farmers use limestone to improve their soil, if the soil is too acidic. Limestone is even used in some medicines and cosmetics, and as a white pigment in toothpaste, paints and plastics. Sandstone Sandstone has been a popular building material since ancient times, especially in houses and cathedrals around the world. This is because it is quite soft and easy to carve. Houses in Lesotho and the Free State were built from sandstone blocks. The Union Buildings in Tshwane is an example of sandstone structures. Sandstone comes in many different colours and so it is often used decoratively, such as in decorative stones, in fireplaces, in decorative columns and pillars in buildings and cathedrals, and to make statues and fountains. Since sandstone is easy to carve, but does not weather, it is often used as paving stones and to make walkways. Decorative columns made Decorative carvings and from sandstone in India. 10 columns made from sandstone on a building. 11 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2712018/05/18 10:32:56 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control272 Paving blocks made from sandstone 12 Shale Shale is also used in buildings, especially as a raw material to make bricks. Shale also splits very easily into thin sheets, and is therefore used as tiles for floors and roofs. Shale is used for floors in some houses in South Africa. Shale splits easily into thin tiles which can be used in flooring and roofs. 13 Cement is also made from shale. The shale is crushed to a powder and heated in a kiln (a kind of stove). Black shale rock is also a very important source of oil and natural gas all over the world.

Now comes the section I am most excited about – learning about fossils and how they formed. Let’s get started! NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2742018/05/18 10:32:57 AM 275 17 Fossils KEY QUESTIONS • What are fossils? • Why were the animals long ago different to animals we can see today? • How do fossils form in rocks? • Why are fossils so important? • What is the Cradle of Humankind in South Africa? Why is it a World Heritage site? 17.1 Fossils in rock These old photographs below are of fossil hunters. These people are splitting open pieces of shale. They are looking for fossils in the rock. The layers of shale split apart and the shape of a leaf or an animal can be seen in the rock. The shape we see is called a fossil. All over the world, people find fossils of leaves and bones in the layers of sedimentary rock. These leaves and bones came from plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. They were not like the plants and animals we see today. New words • fossil • evidence • preserve • ice age Did you know? A paleontologist is a scientist who studies prehistoric life, mostly by looking at fossils. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2752018/05/18 10:32:57 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control276 Fossils are rock shapes of dead plants and animals A fossil is not the real leaf or bone you see; the rock has kept the shape of the leaf or the bone. This rock shape is called a fossil. Below you can see a photo of a fossil of the head of a dinosaur, and the next image shows you what scientists think this dinosaur looked like. The fossil shape of the head Paleontologists think that of Massospondylus, Massospondylus looked like a dinosaur that lived in the this. 2 eastern Free State about 200 million years ago. 1 This fossil of the dinosaur’s head is not the actual bones, but it is actually now a rock in the shape of the dinosaurs bones. Over millions of years, the bones turned into rock. So, a fossil is the remains of an ancient plant or animal which has been preserved in a rock. Most of the organisms that paleontologists study are now extinct. This means that they are no longer alive today. Why are fossils so important? The Earth’s past is fascinating to us!

We can look up in a book and read what someone who lived long ago wrote about that time period. But no human was around millions of years ago to record what happened then. So we have to use other ways to find out about what life was like on Earth millions of years ago. To do this, scientists use fossils. Fossils are actually our most valuable source of information about the ancient past. What can fossils tell us about life long ago? Fossils tell us about the organisms that lived long ago. Imagine the first scientists that discovered a dinosaur’s bones. These bones are much bigger than the bones of any other animal on Earth today. This immediately told the scientists that the animals from the past were really big! Tyrannosaurus rex’s name means ‘tyrant lizard king’ and it was an enormous predator. Fossils can tell us much more than just which organisms lived millions of years ago. By studying fossils of plants and animals, scientists can also work out information on how these organisms grew, what they ate, the environment they lived in, and even some aspects of their behaviour and how they interacted. For example, studying fossilised feaces of an animal can give evidence about what an animal used to eat. Visit When a T-Rex attacks!

So the fossils in these layers will be from earlier times than fossils in rock layers which are closer to the surface. How did the bodies of animals and plants get into the rock? Have you perhaps seen the body of a dead bird? Dogs, flies, ants and beetles all take away the parts of the body. The wind blows away the feathers and soon there is nothing left to see. But sometimes it does not happen like that. Imagine an animal died near a river. There was a flood and the river quickly covered the body with sand. In years after that, more floods brought more sand and put it on top. The heavy sand pressed down on the bottom sediments. Slowly, the bottom sediments became sedimentary rock. Let’s try to make our own model to understand how fossils are formed in sedimentary rock. Visit How are fossils formed? goo.gl/qyZTC NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2792018/05/18 10:32:58 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control280 ACTIVITY 17.1: How to make a model of a body fossil Fossil hunters look for fossils in sedimentary rock. They never know whether they will find a fossil or not. They have to split open the rock layers to see if there are any fossils. You are going to make a model of some rock that you will split open. MATERIALS: • Small container (plastic dish or bottom of a milk carton) • Leaf with ribs that stand out or an animal bone (chicken bone) • Vaseline • Plaster of paris INSTRUCTIONS: Each group must make a model rock with a fossil. Day one: 1. Spread Vaseline over the back of your leaf or your chicken bone. 2. Take your container to your teacher. Pour the fresh plaster of paris mixture into the container. The plaster of paris will begin to set hard in about 10 minutes, so you must be ready with your bone or leaf. Bone with vaseline Wet plaster Cardboard box Press the bone only halfway into the plaster. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2802018/05/18 10:32:59 AM 281Chapter 17: Fossils281 3. Now put your leaf or bone onto the top of the wet plaster of paris, and press it gently into the plaster. The bone must go in only halfway as you see in in the picture below. The leaf must go only far enough to leave the shape of its ribs in the plaster. 4. Leave the plaster to set (to get hard). Notice how hot your container becomes while the plaster is setting. Day two: 5. Pull out the leaf or the bone. It will come out easily because the plaster does not stick onto the Vaseline. 6. Now you have an impression of the leaf or the bone. An impression is like a footprint in mud. 7. Spread a very thin layer of Vaseline into the impression and around the impression, as you see in the picture below. Vaseline in and around the impression When you pull the leaf or bone out, you leave an impression in the hard plaster. Smear Vaseline into the impression and around it. 8. Collect some runny wet plaster of paris from your teacher and pour it over the Vaseline to cover the old plaster and fill the container almost to the top. Let the new plaster set for a day. Day three: 9. Tear off the cardboard or cut off the plastic container from the plaster rock you have made. The fossil is hidden inside. You can paint the plaster to look like a rock.

Now give your rock to another group and get a different rock from them. Do not tell the other group what fossil is in your rock. 11. Use the knife to tap gently on the edge of the rock. Use a stick to tap on the back of the knife blade, so that you do not hit too hard. 12. Your rock should split open if you tap in the right place. When it splits open, you will see a cast of a leaf or a bone on the top layer. The cast has the shape of the impression, but the impression goes inward and the cast stands up. Cast of the bone You should find a cast of the bone. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2822018/05/18 10:33:00 AM 283Chapter 17: Fossils283 QUESTIONS: 1. Look carefully at the cast and try to draw the leaf or the bone as it really was. 2. Try to work out what kind of plant the leaf came from, or what kind of animal the bone came from. 3. Is the cast (the shape) really a bone, or really a leaf? 4. Do you remember learning about plaster of paris in the second term in Matter and Materials? What properties of plaster of paris make it useful in this activity? Now that you have seen an impression of an object can be made by using plaster of paris, let’s have a closer look at how a dinosaur fossil were made millions of years ago. Look at the pictures below and read the explanations for each stage of the fossil formation process. Long, long ago, a dinosaur dies on the banks of a river, such as this Triceratops in the picture. The flesh of the dinosaur decomposes, or other animals eat it. So, only the skeleton remains. There was a flood and the river rose and covered the skeleton with mud and sand. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2832018/05/18 10:33:00 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control284 Over time, more floods deposit more layers of sand and mud over the skeleton. Over thousands of years, the bottom layers start to become compacted and turn into sedimentary rock. Under the ground, water carried substances from rock into each little space where a bone had been. Rock took the place of bone. We say the bones were fossilised. A fossil bone has the same shape as the original bone, but is much heavier. Millions of years later, the conditions of the environment above the skeleton may change. The rock is eroded and weathered over time by wind and water and the fossil is exposed on the surface. A scientist sees the fossil and a great discovery is made! Other scientists join in and they excavate the fossil by carefully removing the rock and sand around the skeleton. The fossils will be carefully packed and taken to a NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2842018/05/18 10:33:01 AM 285Chapter 17: Fossils285 museum or research centre. Here the scientists will study them to see what they can learn about prehistoric life. They will try to reassemble the bones into a full skeleton – this may take many months to do! 17.2 Body and trace fossils We have seen many different fossils so far in this chapter. These fossils can be divided into two groups: • Body fossils • Trace fossils A body fossil shows you the shape of the body of the plant or animal. Body fossils include teeth, bones, shells, stems, leaves and seeds. Sometimes an animal left only a sign that it has been there. For example, if you walk across wet cement you might leave a footprint, which will be preserved in the cement when it hardens. Look at the photos below. A footprint which has A dinosaur left its footprint in hardened in the cement. 7 the mud, and the mud turned to rock. This is a trace fossil. 8 Visit Fossilisation video. goo.gl/b906Z New words • body fossil • trace fossil NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2852018/05/18 10:33:01 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control286 Some ancient animals, like dinosaurs, may have walked across wet mud and left footprints in the mud, like in the picture below. The dinosaur leaves a trace behind. Over millions of years, this footprint can be preserved and become a trace fossil. QUESTIONS Use the diagram below as well as your previous knowledge of how sedimentary rock forms to write captions for each stage of the formation of a trace fossil. Trace fossils were also made from animals’ nests, eggs and droppings. Some fossils of ancient organisms look similar to plants and animals that are alive today. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2862018/05/18 10:33:01 AM 287Chapter 17: Fossils287 Marine fossils that look very similar to the shells we get today. 9 17.3 Importance of South African fossils Did you know that South Africa is world famous when it comes to important fossil finds? South Africa has a very rich fossil record of plants, animals and early humans. Let’s take a look at some of these. QUESTIONS Do you know of any important fossil findings in your area? If not, find out where the nearest fossil finding is to you. Earliest life forms Some of the most ancient fossils that are known to exist were found in rocks in the Barberton area in Mpumalanga. Do you know where this is in South Africa? Look it up on a map. These fossils are more than 3 000 million years old! They look like blue-green bacteria. QUESTIONS What are bacteria? Find out and write down a short explanation. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2872018/05/18 10:33:01 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control288 Earliest plants Do you know where Grahamstown is in the Eastern Cape? Grahamstown is famous in the archaeological world for having some of the oldest and best preserved fossils of early plants from millions of years ago. Look at the shape of Africa and South America on the classroom globe. The shapes could fit together like in this picture below. This diagram shows how scientists think the continents of Earth used to look millions and millions of years ago. This was called Pangaea. A South African scientist thought that perhaps Africa and South America had been joined together long ago. But nobody knew if this was true. Then scientists found fossils of a plant called glossopteris in rocks in South Africa and they found fossils of the same plant in South America. This made more people think that perhaps Africa and South America were once joined, very long ago. The image below shows how scientists think the plant glossopteris used to grow in Pangaea. 1 2 3 5 4 6 Pangaea, showing the growing of glossopteris in dark green. QUESTIONS Which number represents South America and which number represents Africa today in the image above? New words • Pangaea • glossopteris • therapsids • ancestor • coelacanth • hominid NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2882018/05/18 10:33:01 AM 289Chapter 17: Fossils289 These are fossils of glossopteris leaves. 10 QUESTIONS Do you think this fossil of glossopteris leaves is a trace or body fossil? Explain your answer. Dinosaurs Fossils of dinosaurs have been found all over the world. But one of the best places in the whole world to find dinosaur fossils is the sedimentary rock in the Drakensberg Mountains and the Maluti Mountains in southern Africa. QUESTIONS Where are the Drakensberg Mountains located in South Africa? Write down the names of the provinces. Mammal-like reptiles Reptiles came before mammals, but the fossil records shows us animals that were similar to mammals as we know them today, even though they were actually reptiles. These in-between animals are called therapsids. Fossils of these animals have been found in the Karoo in South Africa. NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2892018/05/18 10:33:01 AM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control290 Fossils of some of the first mammals on Earth were also found in the Drakensberg rocks in the Eastern Cape and in Lesotho. A fossil of a therapsid found in the Karoo. A therapsid is a small dinosaur with some features of mammals. 11 QUESTIONS Where is the Karoo? A town in the Karoo is Graaff Reinet. Find this town on the classroom globe. Find it on a map. Name some other towns found in the Karoo. A strange fish that lives in the sea near South Africa Look at the photo below of a fish that was caught in the sea near East London. The fish is called a coelacanth. A preserved coelacanth in a museum. 12 Visit Finding the coelacanth (video). goo.gl/pu6Ia NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2902018/05/18 10:33:02 AM 291Chapter 17: Fossils291 Scientists from other countries rushed to South Africa to see this coelacanth fish. They could not believe that any coelacanths still lived in the sea. The scientists knew about coelacanths because they had studied their fossils in England and Germany, but the fossils were 80 million years old. They thought that coelacanths had all died millions of years ago! We now call coelacanths ‘living fossils’! QUESTIONS How is this fish different from other fish? Look at its tail and its front fins. The Cradle of Humankind The Cradle of Humankind is a World Heritage Site. It is called the ‘Cradle of Humankind’ as many people and scientists now believe that this was where humans first evolved. The birthplace of humans is right in our country! I just love learning more and more about what makes our country so special and wonderful. We can be proudly South African!

The name Maropeng, a Setswana word, means ‘’return to place of origin’’. The museum at Maropeng, Cradle of Humankind. 13 In the Cradle Of Humankind about 1 000 fossils of pre- humans have been discovered, dating back millions of years. Altogether there are 15 major fossil sites in the Cradle of Humankind. The Sterkfontein Caves is the most famous. Swartkrans and Bolt Farm are also sites at the Cradle of Humankind where fossils have been found. The entrance to Sterkfontein Caves is down a long, winding staircase. 14 Visit The Cradle of Humankind website. goo.gl/ZDkU7 NatSci&Tech_Gr5_Book.indb 2922018/05/18 10:33:03 AM 293Chapter 17: Fossils293 The fossils of Mrs Ples and Little foot were both discovered at Maropeng, as well as thousands of hominid fossils (human ancestors), as well as plants and animals. The cranium of an australopithecus africanus found in Sterkfontein caves at Maropeng Tourists come from all over the world, including South Africa, to view the caves and fossils at the Cradle of Humankind, and to get immense knowledge on the history of humankind. If you live in or near Johannesburg, maybe you have been lucky enough to visit Maropeng and the Cradle of Humankind!

For example, the number 485 627 is made up of the following parts: If you write the parts on pieces of paper, you can put them on top of each other to form the number symbol, as shown above. Notice how the zeros of the various parts are hidden in the number symbol. The place value parts are also used to make up the number name: 400 000 80 000 5 000 600 20 7 4 hundred and 85 thousand six hundred and twenty-seven A number can also be expressed (written) as the sum of its place value parts: 485 627 = 400 000 + 80 000 + 5 000 + 600 + 20 + 7 400 000 + 80 000 + 5 000 + 600 + 20 + 7 is called the expanded notation or place value expansion of 485 627. 1.

(c) Find the smallest number greater than 3 not yet crossed out. It is 5. Cross out all the numbers greater than 5 that are multiples of 5. (d) The smallest number greater than 5 not yet crossed out should be 7. Cross out all the numbers greater than 7 that are multiples of 7. (e) Write down all the numbers that you did not cross out. These are the numbers that remain after implementing the above sieve: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 We call these numbers the prime numbers smaller than 100. This method is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes, used in ancient Greece in about 240 BC. The numbers that the “sieve” catches (the remaining numbers) are called prime numbers. The sieve lets through all non-prime numbers. Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 122016/12/15 4:20:41 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 13 The number 35 can be written as the product of two whole numbers in two ways: 35 = 1 × 35 and 35 = 5 × 7. So 35 has four factors, namely 1, 5, 7 and 35. Factors are the same as divisors: 1, 5, 7 and 35 are the only divisors of 35 because they are the only whole numbers that divide exactly into 35. 8. How many factors does each of these numbers have? 1 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 20 21 23 25 We can group numbers according to the number of factors they have: • Numbers that have more than two factors are called composite numbers. • Numbers that have only two different factors, namely 1 and itself, are called prime numbers. • 1 is a special number because it is the only number that has only one factor. It is not prime and not composite. 9. Sort all the whole numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... , 100 into the three groups in the table. Prime numbersComposite numbersNot prime or composite 2 3 . . . 4 6 . . . 1 . . . When a number is multiplied by 1, the answer is the number itself, for example 37 × 1 = 37. This is called the multiplicative property of 1. When 0 is added to a number, the answer is the number itself, for example 37 + 0 = 37. This is called the additive property of 0.

Tshepo: 140 − 6 + 8 = 134 + 8 = 142 He first calculated 7 × 20 and 4 × 2, before he added and subtracted. To avoid confusion like this when reading instructions to do calculations, people all over the world use the rules given on the next page.

Example: The calculation plan 30 − 6 + 8 − 5 + 7 indicates that you have to do the following: 30 − 6 = 24 24 + 8 = 32 32 − 5 = 27 27 + 7 = 34 If you don’t do the calculations from left to right, you will get a different answer. For example, if you first calculate 6 + 8 = 14 and 5 + 7 = 12 and then 30 − 14 = 16 and then 16 − 12, the answer is 4. That is why you should always follow the above rule, unless you replace the plan with an equivalent plan. Suppose you want to state that 8 should be added to 6, and 7 to 5, and the two answers subtracted from 30. The use of brackets makes it possible to write such instructions. Brackets are used to indicate that certain calculations should be done before others. Example: The calculation plan 30 − (6 + 8) − (5 + 7) indicates that the following should be done: 6 + 8 = 14 5 + 7 = 12 30 − 14 = 16 16 − 12 = 4 When a calculation plan includes multiplication, the multiplication is done first and the remaining calculations are done from left to right. Example: The calculation plan 7 × 20 − 6 + 4 × 2 indicates that the following should be done: 7 × 20 = 140 4 × 2 = 8 140 − 6 = 134 134 + 8 = 142 Note that there is an equivalent plan that will produce the same result if it is performed from left to right, namely 30 + 8 + 7 – 6 – 5: 30 + 8 = 38 38 + 7 = 45 45 − 6 = 39 39 − 5 = 34 Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 202016/12/15 4:20:42 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 21 6.

If some numbers are missing, a number sentence is called open, for example: 64 + . . . = 100 To complete this open number sentence you have to find out what you need to add to 64 to reach 100. If all the numbers are given, a number sentence is called closed. For example 64 + 36 = 100 is called a closed number sentence. Open number sentences can be written in different ways: 700 + . . . = 1 000 700 + = 1 000 700 + ? = 1 000 700 + a number = 1 000 700 + = 1 000 700 + x = 1 000 1.

In fact, you also know that 8 thousands + 5 thousands = 13 thousands, in other words 8 000 + 5 000 = 13 000, and that 80 000 + 50 000 = 130 000 (130 thousands). If you know an addition fact, you can always make two subtraction facts from it. For example, if you know that 8 + 5 = 13, you also know that 13 − 5 = 8 and 13 − 8 = 5. You then also know the following subtraction facts, and more: 130 − 80 1 300 − 500 130 − 50 13 000 − 5 000 1. Use the fact that 7 + 8 = 15 to give the answers for the following: (a) 8 000 + 7 000 (b) 15 000 − 8 000 2. Use the fact 9 + 6 = 15 to write five other addition facts and five subtraction facts. If you know one fact, you can easily make other facts. An easy way to make a new fact from a known addition fact is to transfer part of one number to the other number. For example, if you know that 30 + 90 = 120, you can make new facts as shown below. 100 100 300 + 900 = 1 200 400 + 800 = 1 200 500 + 700 = 1 200 3. Start with 700 + 700 = 1 400 and use the above transfer method to form five different addition facts. Here is another way to form new facts from a fact that you know, for example 600 + 600 = 1 200. 600 + 600 = 1 200 + 100+ 100 600 + 700 = 1 300 If you add another 100 on both sides, you get 600 + 800 = 1 400. This may be called the “add on both sides” method. Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 292016/12/15 4:20:43 PM 30 UNiT 3: WhOLe NUMBerS: ADDiTiON AND SUBTrACTiON 4.

Start from 20 + 30 = 50 and use different methods to form ten different addition facts and twenty different subtraction facts. The “doubles” are easy addition facts to know, for example 30 + 30 = 60 and 4 000 + 4 000 = 8 000. We can also say 3 tens + 3 tens = 6 tens and 4 thousands + 4 thousands = 8 thousands. 6.

Show how the answers for each of the following calculations can be found by first doubling one of the numbers.

They start together but Tebogo walks faster than Jan. After some time Jan has walked 30 m and Tebogo has walked 45 m. How far are they now from each other? You can make a rough drawing to help you to understand this question. A useful way of forming subtraction facts that you do not yet know, is to “fill up” to the nearest multiple of 10 or 100 or 1 000 or 10 000. For example if you do not know how much 1 200 − 700 is, you can ask yourself how much you should add to 700 to get 1 200. To answer this question you can first “fill up” to 1 000, and show your thinking like this: 700 + 300 → 1 000 + 200 = 1 200 We needed to add 300 and 200 to get from 700 to 1 200, so we now know that 1 200 − 700 = 500.

The numbers 1 000, 2 000, 3 000, 4 000 and so on are called multiples of 1 000. The numbers 100 000, 200 000, 300 000, 400 000 and so on are called multiples of 100 000. Mr Nene has to pay R1 424 for water and electricity. He also has to pay R2 783 for property rates, sanitation and waste removal. Which of the following statements will best describe Mr Nene’s situation? Statement A: He needs more than R1 000. Statement B: He needs about R5 000. Statement C: He needs about R3 000. Statement D: He needs about R4 000. To quickly answer the above question, it helps to notice that R1 424 is closer to R1 000 than to R2 000, and R2 783 is closer to R3 000 than to R2 000. So, we can quickly see that Mr Nene has to pay approximately R4 000. To make estimates quickly, it is useful to round numbers off. For example, numbers can be rounded off to the nearest multiple of 10 or 100 or 500 or 1 000 or 1 million or whatever you may decide. A number that is equally far from two multiples is normally rounded off to the higher multiple. For example, 1 500 would be rounded off to 2 000 not to 1 000, if it is rounded off to the “nearest” thousand. When rounding off to the nearest 100, the number 3 450 would be rounded off to 3 500. When rounding off to the nearest 1 000, the number 3 450 would be rounded off to 3 000. 1. Round off each of the following numbers to the nearest thousand.

Also, you need the right attitude when using a calculator. Calculations like 9 + 3, 5 × 6, 30 + 7 and 200 + 300 can be done faster mentally than with a calculator. You should not use a calculator for such calculations. Learning calculator language The calculator cannot think for you. It only does what you tell it to do. So you must learn how to talk calculator language, so that the calculator can understand you! If you want to use the calculator to solve a word problem, you must first translate from English into the language of arithmetic, and then into calculator language. Calculator language is written as a keystroke sequence using the different kinds of keys on the calculator. There are many different kinds of calculators. Some are called simple calculators and some scientific calculators. here we work only with a very simple calculator.

Note that we are using small numbers here only to explain, and so that we can easily check the calculator mentally. But we should only use the calculator when calculating with large numbers. 1. Use your calculator to calculate these. Check by estimating the answers. (a) 11 × 21 (b) 150 ÷ 6 (c) 212 − 103 (d) 136 + 48 (e) 23 × 52 (f) 1 728 − 619 2.

It is very easy to press wrong keys by accident, and then to get wrong answers, for example: • You may press the wrong operation: For example, you may press + instead of − . • You may press the wrong number: For example, you may press 32 instead of 23. Instead of then having to redo everything, you can learn shortcuts to correct different kinds of mistakes. 4. How do we correct the mistake of keying the wrong operation, for example pressing + instead of − , except to start over again? Do the following keystroke sequences on your calculator. Look at the display after every keystroke and try to explain how your calculator works. Try to predict the display before pressing each key. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Describe a method to correct an incorrect operation entry on your calculator. it is a good habit to keep your eyes on the display, so that you can immediately see when you make a typing error. 7+×3= 7+ − 3= 7++3= 7×+3= 7 −+ 3= 7 − ×3= Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 482016/12/15 4:20:45 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 49 5. Your calculator will have a C (clear) key and maybe also an AC (all clear) key. Different calculators use these keys differently. On most calculators the C key clears only the last entry, and on some calculators pressing the C key twice deletes everything. Find out how the correction (clear) key on your calculator works by typing these key sequences. Try to predict what the calculator will display after each keystroke. (a) 2 + 3 C 5 = (b) 2 + 3 C C 2 + 5 = (c) 2 + 3 AC 2 + 5 = (d) 2 × 3 C 5 = (e) 2 × 3 AC 2 × 5 = 6. Suppose you want to calculate 15 + 28 − 12 + 46, but make the following mistakes. In each case type the given keystroke sequence, including the mistake. Then correct the mistake and complete the calculation. If you really make mistakes, correct them too! (a) 15 + 29 (b) 15 + 28 + (c) 15 + 28 − 21 (d) 15 + 28 − 12 − 56 Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 492016/12/15 4:20:45 PM 50 UNiT 3: WhOLe NUMBerS: ADDiTiON AND SUBTrACTiON 7. If you discover that you typed a wrong operation only after you entered the next number, the mistake cannot be corrected in any of the above ways. Ben has a bright idea: He wanted to calculate 35 + 89, but typed 35 − 79. He corrects it like this: 35 − 79 + 79 + 89 = Explain why his method is correct. Checking your work: estimate It is very easy to press wrong keys by accident, and then to get wrong answers. You should develop the habit of always checking calculator answers. 8. Use your calculator to calculate 723 + 489. How do you know if the answer is correct? Mary just types without thinking and did not see that she typed the × and not the + key. She got the answer 353 547. Mary thought the answer was correct because she thinks the calculator is always right. But Cyndi always first estimates the answer before she starts typing on the calculator. See if you understand her reasoning: 723 + 489 is more than 700 + 400 = 1 100 723 + 489 is less than 800 + 500 = 1 300 So the answer must be between 1 100 and 1 300. Only then Cyndi typed on the calculator: 723 × 489 = and just like Mary got the answer 353 547. But Cyndi immediately knew that the answer was wrong and that she must have made a mistake. Then she did it correctly and got 1 212. She was satisfied that the answer seemed reasonable because it is between 1 100 and 1 300. Do you agree? Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 502016/12/15 4:20:45 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 51 9. In each case, first estimate the answer like Cyndi did. Then calculate the answer using your calculator, and decide if your answer seems about right.

It usually is not a good idea to check a calculation by just repeating it, because you often make the same mistake again. It is better to check by using a different method the second time. One way to check is to do the calculation in a different order. 10. Do the following calculations on your calculator in the given order and draw a conclusion. (a) (1) 483 + 159 – 286 (2) 483 − 286 + 159 (b) (1) 276 + 288 + 951 (2) 276 + 951 + 288 (c) (1) 776 − 288 − 259 (2) 776 − 259 − 288 Two different keystroke sequences that give the same answer are called equivalent sequences. You can check calculator results using the rearrangement principle: if you repeat the calculation with a different (but equivalent) keystroke sequence, you will get the same answer.

You must then get the original input number as answer. Sipho must calculate 2 345 + 3 214 − 2 255. He uses this keystroke sequence: 2 345 + 3 214 − 2 255 = and gets 3 304. To check, he continues with 3 304 + 2 255 − 3 214 = and gets 2 345, and knows that the answer 3 304 must be right. Why? 13. Use your calculator to calculate each of the following.

The story goes that a long time ago a stranger reached a village and asked: “Will I be able to reach the next village before dark?” A wise old woman looked at the sun and then instructed the man: “Please walk to the tree over there and back.” The man thought it was strange, but did as he was asked. When he had returned to the old woman, she laughed: “Yes, yes you will definitely reach the next village before it is dark.” “Thank you,” said the stranger, took his bag, and continued on his journey. The next day, when the sun was more or less in the same position, one of the older villagers said: “I am going to walk to the next village.” The wise old woman said: “I do not think you should go now because you will not reach the village before it is dark.” 2. Discuss: How did the wise old woman know that the stranger would reach the next village before dark? 3. Why did the woman think that the older villager would not reach the next village before dark? 4. Suppose one late afternoon your friend invites you to watch a sporting event at his home.

Centuries before the birth of Christ are counted backwards. For example, the pyramids in Egypt were built about 3 000 years before the birth of Christ, written as 3000 BC. We are now living in the 21st century, meaning the 21st century After Christ (AC). Nowadays people are increasingly using the expression “Common Era” (CE) instead of AC, and “Before the Common Era” (BCE) instead of BC because it is more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people. Instead of 3000 BC we write 3000 BCE. 3. Mutodi says he does not understand why 2016 is in the 21st century and not in the 20th century.

This then makes it possible to calculate past or future time, for example to calculate how many days until a certain event takes place. The calendar year (the number of days in the year) must be synchronised to the cycle of the seasons, so that the seasons start on the same dates every year. This means that the calendar year must be synchronised to the solar year (the exact time that it takes the Earth to move around the Sun once). The problem with designing a calendar is that a calendar year must have a whole number of days (why?), but the solar year is not a whole number of days (it is about 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 46 seconds). To solve the problem, we must approximate the solar year with a whole number of days, over a period of time. Throughout history, people tried to make better calendars by making better and useful approximations of the solar year. This is done by adding extra whole days in some years. Roman Calendar The Roman Calendar was invented by King Romulus at around 753 BCE. It was a lunar calendar, based on the phases of the moon. The year started in March and had 10 months with a total of 304 days, with 61 days in the winter not included. Around 700 BCE King Pompilius added the months of January and February to the calendar, increasing the calendar year to 355 days. The addition of two extra months meant that some of the months’ names no longer agreed with their position in the calendar. For example, December was originally the 10th month (deci = tenth). 1. Do some research about the origins of the names of the months, and the names of the days of the week. Why July? Why Monday? Julian Calendar To create a more standardised calendar, the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar followed the advice of Sosigenes, an astronomer and mathematician from Alexandria in Egypt. He made some sweeping changes to the calendar. This calendar was named the Julian Calendar. Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 812016/12/15 4:21:04 PM 82 UNiT 5: TiMe • To bring the calendar back in step with the seasons, the year 46 BCE was made 445 days long. • The year 45 BCE began on 1 January, not in March as before. • The solar year was approximated as 365 days 6 hours or 365 1 4 days. This meant that the calendar year was a whole number of days over a period of 4 years. Not all years had the same number of days: three normal years had 365 days, and every fourth year had 366 days (called a leap year). The extra day was 29 February. 2. What is the error (the time difference) between the Julian calendar year of 365 d 6 h and the real solar year of 365 d 5 h 48 min 46 sec (a) in one year (b) in 1 000 years? Gregorian Calendar The Julian Calendar was effective for many centuries. However, it was 11 min 14 sec too long. By the 16th century it was about10 days ahead of the seasons. Pope Gregory XIII implemented the advice of astronomers: • To bring the calendar in step with the seasons, the day after 5 October 1582 was designated as 15 October, removing 10 days from the calendar. • The solar year was approximated as 365 d 5 h 49 min 12 sec or 365 97 400 days. Over a period of 400 years, this is 3 days less than the Julian Calendar. To make this change, it was suggested that 3 out of every 4 century years should not be leap years (as they would have been in the Julian Calendar). The new rule for leap years in the Gregorian Calendar was: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. The Gregorian Calendar is now the internationally accepted calendar. 3. What correction did the Gregorian Calendar bring to the Julian Calendar? That is, what is the time difference between the Julian calendar year of 365 d 6 h (365 1 4 days) and the Gregorian calendar year of 365 d 5 h 49 min 12 sec (365 97 400 days) (a) in one year (b) in 400 years?

Wherever you are, the sun is at its highest point in the sky at exactly midday (noon). However, midday (noon) is not at the same time everywhere across the world, because the Earth is round and rotates around its axis. Midday is at the same time everywhere only in the same time zone. People who live in the same time zone set their watches to the same time. If you travel out of a time zone, you have to change the time on your watch to the new time in that time zone. The time in each time zone differs by one hour from the time zone next to it. The map below shows how the world is divided into time zones. 0 +2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12-2+1-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-1 London Durban Sydney Mexico City New York City San Francisco Mumbai Beijing Singapore To k y o Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 842016/12/15 4:21:04 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 85 This time zone map is very basic and does not show two other aspects of time across the world: • Some countries have different time zones across the country (for example the USA). Other countries use just one time zone for the whole country. For example, South Africa uses the Durban time zone for the whole country. • Many countries use daylight savings time, where the time is changed by an hour twice in the year to adapt for seasonal difference in sunlight, for example the time the sun rises. South Africa does not use daylight savings time. 1. The time zone map shows that when it is 15:00 in Durban, the time is 23:00 in Sydney and 05:00 in San Francisco. What is the time difference between (a) Durban and Sydney (b) Sydney and San Francisco? 2.

A certain orange farm has two orange groves (orchards) with 500 trees in each grove. At the start of the harvesting season the managers gather data in order to estimate the number of oranges they can expect to export. They have to know how many oranges they can expect to harvest, how many boxes to order for packing, and how much space to book on ships to transport the oranges to different countries. 1.

Write down your ideas. 2. The pictograph below gives the widths of 100 oranges from two trees (one tree in each grove) on the orange farm. One of the managers of the farm investigated the groves and thinks the two trees are representative of the orange trees in each grove. We will use the oranges from these trees to get an idea of the different sizes of oranges they can expect to harvest. (a) When one of the other managers of the farm saw the graph, she said: “It looks like the one tree has smaller oranges than the other tree.” Why do you think she said this? Say if you agree. (b) If you want to make two groups, namely big oranges and small oranges, which measurement would you choose to separate the oranges into the two groups? Explain how you decided on this measurement. (c) If you want to have the same number of oranges in the two groups in question (b), which measurement will you choose to separate the oranges into the two groups?

Say what you think: (a) If you look at two other trees from the groves, will you be surprised if there are many oranges that are larger than 90 mm? (b) Will you be surprised if there are no oranges that are between 60 mm and 70 mm? (c) What size do you expect most oranges to be? (d) Write a short paragraph to say what you learnt about the sizes of the oranges in the two groves. The mode and the median can be used to describe data that vary. Use the mode if the measurement or category that occurs most often, occurs much more often than the others. Use the median if you want to find the middle measurement.

What kinds of citrus fruit (lemons, oranges, soft citrus etc.) are sold in your town in a particular month? 2. How does the number of oranges in a bag vary? 3. Pose your own question, for example: How much juice can you squeeze from an orange? Do all types of oranges produce the same amount of juice? Step 1: Plan and collect data 1. Decide among your classmates where you will gather the data to answer question 1. Decide who will go to different shops and fruit vendors. Do some research about the different types of citrus so that you can recognise the fruit if their names are not given in the shops. 2. For question 2, decide for how many bags of oranges (or another citrus fruit of your choice) each classmate should count how many oranges there are in a bag. Make sure that each bag is only counted once. If you gather information from an informal vendor, you may have to ask him or her how many oranges there were in the bag when he or she bought the bag. 3. Plan how to collect data to answer your own question (question 3). Step 2: Organise and summarise the data 1. Use a tally table to summarise the kinds of citrus fruit sold in your area (question 1). How many shops or vendors sell each kind? 2. Use a tally table to summarise the numbers of oranges in all the bags of oranges checked by the class (question 2). The learners who gathered information from vendors may not have data to tally here. 3. Organise and summarise the data that you collected to answer your own question (question 3).

The horizontal axis will show categories of citrus. 2. A suitable graph for question 2’s data is a pictograph. The horizontal axis will show a number line. 3. Choose a suitable graph to represent the data you collected to answer your own question (question 3). Step 4: Analyse, interpret and report data Share the work among classmates. Write up the story of your project and answer the questions. Use your knowledge of mode and median to interpret your data. Think of ways to use the information.

You already know that in a number sequence like 6, 12, 18, 24, ... , although the numbers change (are not the same), • there is some horizontal pattern that does not change (is always the same for all numbers) and • there is a vertical calculation plan (rule) that does not change and is the same for all the input and output numbers. Here are the horizontal and vertical patterns for 6, 12, 18, 24, ... : Input numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 ... Output numbers: 6 12 18 24 30 ... We can describe and write the patterns in such sequences in different ways: in words, in a table, in a flow diagram or as a calculation plan (also called a rule). These descriptions help us to solve problems like these: 1. To continue the sequence, in other words to find the next numbers in the sequence. 2. To calculate numbers further on in the sequence, for example the 100th number in the sequence. This is the same as calculating the output number if the input number is 100. 3. To find out the position of a number in the sequence, for example: Is 436 the 1st, 50th, ... 87th number in the sequence? This is the same as finding the input number if the output number is 436. 4. To decide if a number, for example 438, is in the sequence or not. ×6×6×6×6×6 +6+6+6+6 Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 1082016/12/15 4:21:15 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 1] 109 8.1 Revising sequences of multiples 1.

In this section, you will refresh your memory of multiplication facts. 1. For which of the following can you give the answers straight away? Write down only those answers that you know immediately. You can answer the others later. (a) 2 × 7 (b) 3 × 5 (c) 6 × 7 (d) 70 × 10 (e) 8 × 90 (f) 6 × 4 (g) 6 × 8 (h) 6 × 9 A multiplication fact that you know can often help you to build knowledge of another multiplication fact. Here are some examples: If you know that 2 × 7 = 14, you also know that 7 × 2 = 14. You can easily see that 2 × 70 = 140 and 70 × 2 = 140 2 × 700 = 1 400 and 700 × 2 = 1 400 2 × 7 000 = 14 000 and 7 000 × 2 = 14 000. If you know that 2 × 70 = 140 and 70 × 2 = 140, you can also easily see that 20 × 70 = 1 400 and 70 × 20 = 1 400 200 × 70 = 14 000 and 70 × 200 = 14 000 20 × 700 = 14 000 and 700 × 20 = 14 000 200 × 700 = 140 000 and 700 × 200 = 140 000, and so on. You can double the answer of 2 × 7 = 14 to get 4 × 7 = 28 and then you also know that 7 × 4 = 28.

See which facts you can build from 3 × 7 = 21, and record your results in a table like the one above. 4. See which facts you can build from 4 × 6 = 24, and record your results in a table like the one above. You saw earlier that in order to build new facts from 2 × 7 = 14, you can double the answer to get 4 × 7 = 28, and then build further from there. Here is another way to build on a known fact: If you know that 4 × 7 = 28, you can add another 7 to get 5 × 7 = 35. If you know that 6 × 8 = 48, you can add another 8 to get 7 × 8 = 56. 5. Now use addition, as explained above, to build new facts from each of the following: (a) 7 × 7 = 49 (b) 5 × 6 = 30 (c) 2 × 9 = 18 (d) 5 × 7 = 35 (e) 7 × 9 = 63 (f) 6 × 4 = 24 6.

Are 10, 6 and 15 the only factors of 900? 7. Write 900 as a product of three other numbers. 8. Can you think of more ways in which you can write 900 as a product of three numbers? If you can, write them down. 9. Can you write 900 as a product of four or more numbers? Try as many ways as you can. 10. Have you found all the ways? Think of a way in which you would know whether you have found all the ways or not. Read what Lindiwe did to find all the factors of 900. Lindiwe started with 10 × 6 × 15 as factors of 900. She noticed that 10 can be written as 2 × 5 and that 15 can be written as 3 × 5. 900 = 10 × 6 × 15 = 2 × 5 × 6 × 3 × 5 (Then she noticed that 6 = 2 × 3) = 2 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 What Lindiwe did here was to break a number down into factors. 11. When you combine any two of the three factors of 900 shown above, you can write 900 as a product of five numbers. Do this in two different ways. When a number is divided by one of its factors the remainder is 0. Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 1302016/12/15 4:21:22 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 2] 131 12. Now break down each of the following numbers into factors. Start by writing the number as a product of two factors. Then see if you can break down these two factors into more factors, like Lindiwe did. Continue in this way until none of the factors can be broken down any further. (a) 90 (b) 136 (c) 150 (d) 59 (e) 57 (f) 144 What happened when you wanted to break down the number 59 in question 12(d)? You probably found 59 = 1 × 59 but could not continue. This is because some numbers, such as number 59, have no factors other than the number itself and 1. Numbers with only two different factors, namely 1 and the number itself, are called prime numbers. A factor that is a prime number, is called a prime factor. 13. Which of the following numbers are prime numbers? 15 51 59 57 43 91 42 27 101 14.

Take a look at how she uses factors to multiply 687 × 42. Linda thinks of 42 as 6 × 7 and then of 6 as 2 × 3. She then rearranges the factors like this to make it easy: Explanation of the steps: 687 × 42 = 687 × 6 × 7 (because 42 = 6 × 7) = 687 × 2 × 3 × 7 (because 6 = 2 × 3) = (687 × 2) × 3 × 7 = (1 374 × 3) × 7 (687 × 2 = 1 374) = 4 122 × 7 (1 374 × 3 = 4 122) = (4 000 + 100 + 20 + 2) × 7 = 28 000 + 700 + 140 + 14 = 28 854 1. Use Linda’s method and use factors to calculate the following. You don’t have to write any explanations next to your steps.

This is how Sarah started to do 42 × 57: 42 × 57 = 40 × 57 + 2 × 57 Complete the calculation in the way Sarah would do it. 2. How do you think Sarah will calculate these?

This is what he wrote when he calculated 34 × 63: 34 × 63 = 34 × 60 + 34 × 3 Here he calculated 34 × 60: Here he calculated 34 × 3: 34 34 × 60 × 3 240 (60 × 4) 12 (3 × 4) + 1 800 (60 × 30) + 90 (3 × 30) 2 040 102 And then he added up the two totals: 2 040 + 102 2 142 3. Rewrite your work for question 1 in the way Indumiso sets his work out. Indumiso’s way of setting out his work for multiplication is called expanded column multiplication. Later this year you will learn an even shorter way of setting out multiplication. 4. Calculate each of the following. Use the expanded column notation to set out your work. (a) 47 × 38 (b) 54 × 86 (c) 362 × 56 (d) 538 × 464 We also call this way of setting out the work the expanded column notation.

A calculator is a handy tool that can help you to calculate quickly and accurately. But we need the right attitude in using the calculator. Use mental calculation for facts that you should know or should be able to do faster in your head than on the calculator, for example 5 × 6 and 500 × 6. We also use mental methods for estimation to check written or calculator calculations. Use written methods when you need to explain your understanding of the mathematics, for example to explain how you do 349 × 56. Use the calculator for calculating with large numbers or for many repeated calculations when only the answer is important, for example to calculate the answer in word problems. 1. In this exercise use one calculator between two or three classmates. Compete to see who of you can calculate the fastest and correctly. One of you must use the calculator, and the others must calculate mentally. Who wins for each of these calculations? (a) 345 × 45 (b) 30 + 20 (c) 30 × 20 (d) 20 000 + 30 000 (e) 25 × 4 (f) 130 + 330 (g) 20 000 × 3 (h) 678 × 234 2.

We should develop the habit of always checking calculator answers! 1. Use your calculator to calculate 723 × 489. How do you know if the answer is correct? Mary just typed without thinking and did not see that she pressed the + and not the × key. She got the answer 1 212. Mary thought the answer is correct because she thinks the calculator is always right! Cyndi always first estimates the answer before she starts typing on the calculator. See if you understand her reasoning: 723 × 489 is more than 700 × 400 = 280 000 723 × 489 is less than 800 × 500 = 400 000 So the answer must be between 280 000 and 400 000 Only then did she type on the calculator: 723 + 489 = and just like Mary got the answer 1 212. But Cyndi immediately knew that the answer must be wrong, so she must have made a mistake. Then she did it correctly and got 353 547, and was satisfied that the answer seemed reasonable. Do you agree? 2. In each case, first estimate the answer like Cyndi did. Then calculate the answer with your calculator, and decide if your answer looks about right.

So it is important that we always check our calculator answers. You should not check a calculation by just repeating it, because we often make the same mistake again. It is better to check by using a different method the second time. One way to check is to do the calculations in a different order. 1. Do the following calculations on your calculator in the given order and draw a conclusion. (a) (1) 1 716 × 159 ÷ 286 (2) 1 716 ÷ 286 × 159 (b) (1) 276 × 288 × 959 (2) 288 × 959 × 276 (c) (1) 148 896 ÷ 88 ÷ 94 (2) 148 896 ÷ 94 ÷ 88 Two different calculation plans that give the same answer are called equivalent calculation plans. We can check calculator results using the rearrangement principle: if we repeat the calculations in a different (but equivalent) order, we will get the same answer. 2. Calculate each of the following. Check the result by using the rearrangement principle. (a) 543 × 178 × 86 (b) 6 545 ÷ 85 × 28 (c) 1 536 × 287 ÷ 328 (d) 10 976 ÷ 28 ÷ 14 (e) 1 543 × 268 × 128 (f) 154 × 768 ÷ 56 Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 1392016/12/15 4:21:22 PM 140 UNiT 1: WhOLe NUMBerS140 UNiT 2: WhOLe NUMBerS: MULTiPLiCATiON 2.10 Use inverses to check the calculator 1.

We say multiplication and division are inverse operations, because the one undoes or cancels the other. Explanation: 687 × 42 ÷ 42 = (687 × 42) ÷ 42 (one way of grouping) = 687 × (42 ÷ 42) (an equivalent grouping) = 687 × 1 = 687 (a property of 1) 2. Sipho must calculate 234 ÷ 325 × 225. He uses the keystroke sequence: 234 ÷ 325 × 225 = and gets 162 as answer. To check, he continues with 162 ÷ 225 × 325 = and gets 234. Now he knows that the answer 162 must be right. Why? Calculator results can be checked by applying inverse operations to the result, in reverse order. You must then get the original input number as answer.

What number will make the sentence 57 × . . . = 4 731 true? You will study a method of division in the next section. To do division, you have to be good at forming multiples of the numbers that you divide by, for example the number 64 in 3 829 ÷ 64. To form a multiple of a number, you multiply the number by another number. For example: 10 × 64 is 640, so 640 is a multiple of 64. 100 × 64 is 6 400, so 6 400 is a multiple of 64. Doubling may be used in some cases to find multiples. For example, if you know that 40 × 53 = 2 120, you can double 2 120 to find 80 × 53. Halving may also be useful to find multiples. For example, if you know that 100 × 68 = 6 800, you can halve 6 800 to find 50 × 68. 7. To do division you need to be able to answer questions like these. Note that you can use your answers for (a) to easily find the answers for (b). (a) How much are 100 × 73 and 53 × 1 000? (b) How much are 50 × 73 and 53 × 500? (c) How much are 25 × 73 and 53 × 250? (d) How much are 125 × 73 and 53 × 750? The number by which you divide another number is called the divisor.

In the above method, multiples of 73 are added up until the distance from 6 150 is less than 73.

The work to calculate 6 150 ÷ 73 can also be summarised as follows: 3 650 + 730 → 4 380 + 730 → 5 110 + 730 → 5 840 + 219 → 6 059 + 73 → 6 132 or (50 × 73) + (10 × 73) + (10 × 73) + (10 × 73) + (3 × 73) + (1 × 73) = 6 132 We may also think of the division work as movements on a number line.

Their method is to round off the numbers, so that they can easily calculate the estimate mentally. For example, to check 6 804 ÷ 324 they work as follows: • Vusi rounds 6 804 ÷ 324 to 6 000 ÷ 300 and calculates it mentally as 20. • Busi rounds 6 804 ÷ 324 to 6 600 ÷ 300 and calculates it mentally as 22. Then the calculator answer 6 804 ÷ 324 = 21 seems about right. 2.

If 2 3 10 is written as 2,3, why do you think 1 1 2 is written as 1,5? Discuss this with one or two of your classmates. 2 3 10 and 2,3 are two different notations for the same number. 2,3 is the decimal notation. 3 10 has no whole number part and so it is written as 0,3. A comma separates the whole number part from the fraction. The first position after the comma indicates the number of tenths in the number. The second position is for the hundredths. 2. Write the length of each of these strips in fraction notation and in decimal notation. Measure in Yellowsticks. This is one Yellowstick: One Yellowstick (a) (b) 3.

We shall now look at how to do subtraction by breaking numbers down into their place value parts. For example, 79,56 − 45,24 can be calculated like this: 79,56=70+9+ 5 10 + 6 100 45,24=40+5+ 2 10 + 4 100 79,56 − 45,24=30+4+ 3 10 + 2 100 =34,32 In the case of 34,62 − 27,95 the parts that are circled cause difficulties: 34,62=30+4+ 6 10 + 2 100 27,95=20+7+ 9 10 + 5 100 34,62 − 27,95=10+ We cannot subtract 7 from 4. We also cannot subtract 0,9 from 0,6 and 0,05 from 0,02. The difficulties can be resolved by rewriting 30 + 4 + 6 10 + 2 100 as 20 + 13 + 15 10 + 12 100 . We can do this because the two numbers above are identical in value, although they are written differently. Now answer question 2.

It is also very useful to do investigations and to discover aspects of numbers and decimals in particular. 1. You can set up your common (not scientific) calculator to be a counting machine to count in 0,1s. Press 0 . 1 and then press the + key twice and then press = . Keep on pressing the = key. What do you notice? The calculator keeps on counting in 0,1s. It shows 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; ... This is useful if you want to check whether you have completed a sequence of numbers correctly. For example, if you had to complete the sequence 0,3; 0,6; 0,9; ... press 0 . 3 + + = = = = = and there you go! You can even count backwards, by pressing the number that you want to subtract each time, followed by − − and then = . Next, press the number from which you want to count back and then press = = . If you want the calculator to repeatedly multiply by the same number, press the number you want to multiply by, followed by × × and = . Any number that you then press, will be multiplied by that number. You can even divide repeatedly by pressing the number (that is the divisor, the one that you want to divide by) and ÷ ÷ = . Play around with your calculator. Most of the common calculators work like this and it is most useful to know this function. Note that the calculator uses a point (.) and not a comma to separate whole number part and fraction part.

The moment that you press a function key, such as + , − , × , ÷ , or the CANCEL function C , that message is cancelled. So, if you want the calculator to start counting at a certain number, do not press the C key, simply enter the number and = = = . 2. Set up your calculator to count in 0,3s, starting at 20,1. 3. (a) Set up you calculator to count in 0,1s. (b) Enter 11111,11. What is the value of each of the 1s in the number? (c) Now keep on pressing the = key. Describe what you notice. (d) Can you explain what you see? 4. Try the following on your calculator: Enter the number 74 653. You have to “shoot down” each one of the digits, which means you must replace that digit by 0. You can only do this by subtracting a number that will leave 0 in the place of the digit you are aiming at. Example: Number entered: 74 653 If you want to shoot the 3 down, you can subtract 3 on your calculator. The number on the screen will now be 74 650. (a) Now shoot down the 4. What must you subtract? (b) Shoot down the rest of the digits (that is, the 6, 7 and 5) until you have only 0 on your screen. (c) Shoot down the digits of the number 67 452,13, in any order. Write down what you subtract every time. (d) Now shoot down the digits of the number 354 168,27. Shoot them down in ascending order, starting with the 1, then the 2, and so on.

You can also set up your calculator to be a multiplying machine. Press 10 and then × × , followed by = . So your key sequence is 10 × × = . Then press any number and if you press = again, that number will be multiplied by 10. Set up your calculator to multiply by 10. Then type in a decimal number, for example 123,45, followed by = . What do you notice? Explain what you see. 6. Enter this: 100 × × = Then press any number and if you press = again, that number will be multiplied by 100. Set up your calculator to multiply by 100.

So, apart from 3 and 5, 1 and 15 are also factors of 15. 300 can be obtained in many other ways by multiplying numbers, for example: 1 × 300 = 300 3 × 100 = 300 6 × 50 = 300 2 × 3 × 5 × 2 × 5 = 300 So 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 50, 100, 300, ... are also factors of 300. 1.

Think about it for a minute. Do you remember getting 50% in a test? “Percentage” is another word for “hundredths”. 23% means 23 100 , which is the same as 2 10 + 3 100 or 0,23. Instead of saying 23 hundredths we can say 23%. 2. What fraction part of each square below is shaded? Give your answers in percentage notation, fraction notation and decimal notation.

We can also say: A percentage is a fraction written in a different notation. So, to find 6% of 65 is the same as finding 6 100 of 65. This requires dividing by 100. It can easily be done mentally. We need to practise the skill. 1. If you have a calculator available, use it to do the following: (a) 123 ÷ 10 (b) 123 ÷ 100 (c) 123,4 ÷ 10 (d) 1 234 ÷ 100 2.

A Size 4 ball must bounce at least 110 cm high at 5 °C. The data in this table are from an official test. A machine was used to drop the ball from a height of exactly 2 m, and the bounce height was measured with a laser beam. The test was done with a Size 4 ball. Bounce test: Size 4 ball 20 °C5 °C 155 cm123 cm 160 cm127 cm 120 cm121 cm 150 cm120 cm 158 cm119 cm 158 cm121 cm 133 cm119 cm 147 cm130 cm 128 cm126 cm 131 cm128 cm 1. Look at the data in the table. (a) How many times was the ball bounced at each temperature? (b) What questions can you ask about the data? You can test the soccer balls at your school too. Make sure the ball is inflated properly. Drop the ball 10 times from a height of exactly 2 m onto a hard surface. You have to place a measuring tape against the wall before the time, and find a way to mark how high the ball bounces each time. however, you will struggle to measure accurately and your data may be invalid.

(The first bounce at each temperature has been drawn in.) Give your graph a heading and a key. (d) The ball was tested at two temperatures, 20 °C and 5 °C. How do you think the temperature influences the bounce height of a soccer ball? Explain why you think so. There is only one height that is the lowest bounce height, and one height that is the highest bounce height. The lowest and highest values do not help us to better understand how high the other eight bounces were. We must look for a number that will tell us what is going on between the lowest and highest measures. (e) Which bounce height is a good height to tell the story of the results of the bounce test at 20 °C? Say how you chose the number. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0102030405060708090100110120130140150160170 Bounce height in cm Key: Bounce number Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 2692016/12/15 4:21:49 PM 270 UNiT 9: DATA hANDLiNG (f) The middlemost value in a data set is called the median. Find the median of the bounce heights at 20 °C. How to find the median Place the 10 bounce heights on a number line so that they are arranged from lowest to highest. Make a mark on the number line exactly halfway between the fifth and the sixth bounce height. The median is the number that you read off at the mark. (g) Write a sentence in which you use the median to tell the story of the bounce heights at 20 °C. 2. Do you agree with this report of the bounce height of the ball at 5 °C? Compare the data on the graph to decide. At 5 °C the ball bounced between about 119 cm and about 130 cm high. The lowest bounce height is well above the FIFA requirement of 110 cm. The median bounce height is 122 cm. So the high bounces are those that bounced between 122 cm and 130 cm. 3. Think critically about this situation: Schools usually practise soccer in the afternoon when the temperature is around 20 °C. However, they play matches on Saturday mornings, when the temperature is often much lower than 20 °C. How will you advise the team that will use this ball to play a match on a cold day? How much difference must they expect in the bounce height compared to warmer conditions? 9.2 Analysing and interpreting data in a pictograph Fikile is a big soccer fan.

Gather data from all learners in your school about the way they travel to school. Make sure you find out about all the types of transport. • Question 1: Of all the learners in your school, who makes use of what kind of transport? • Question 2: Of all the learners that make use of a certain kind of transport (for example walking), who are in which grade? • Question 3: Ask your own question, for example: How long does it take to get to school with the different kinds of transport? 1. Think of the questions you have to ask to get the information. For example, for question 3 you may want to know how far the learners travel as well as the kind of transport they use. Or you may want to know at what time they leave their homes to be in time for school. 2. Use your questions in point 1 and the kinds of transport you have learnt about earlier in this unit to make a questionnaire to gather data. 3. Share the work between all the learners in your class. Decide who will gather the data from each grade. Each learner must only be interviewed once. 4. Work together to tally the information in the questionnaires and calculate frequencies. For example, work with the questionnaires answered by Grade 1 learners and organise the data about the numbers of learners that use each kind of transport. Then do the same for each of the other grades. Think of other ways to make categories to organise the data. 5. Draw bar graphs to show the information in the data. 6. With each graph also write down the question you wanted to answer; then say how you read the graph to answer the question. 7. Compare the information between grades to make conclusions, for example: Do Grade 1 to 3 learners tend to use different kinds of transport than Grade 6 and 7 learners? You can also compare the times at which learners using different kinds of transport leave for school in the morning.

In Grade 5 we saw that there were other metric units that we seldom use in everyday life: Kilometre (km) Hectometre ( hm) Decametre ( dam) Metre (m) Decimetre (dm) Centimetre (cm) Millimetre (mm) 1101001 00010 000100 0001 000 000 Units on the right are smaller units than units on the left, for example a millimetre is smaller than a centimetre. Each unit in the table is ten times the size of the unit on its right, for example 100 000 cm = 10 × 100 000 mm = 1 000 000 mm. Because the metric system is based on tens it is called a decimal system of measurement. This table can make converting between units very easy. To convert between units, you can write the number you want to convert under the unit you are converting from. Mark the unit you are converting to. If you are converting from a bigger unit to a smaller unit, then you multiply by 10 each time as you move from column to column to a lower unit, for example: •Write 25 km as m. 25 km → 25 × 10 Hm → 25 × 10 × 10 Dm = 25 × 10 × 10 × 10 m = 25 000 m •Write 3,25 m as mm. 3,25 m → 3,25 × 10 dm → 3,25 × 10 × 10 cm = 3,25 × 10 × 10 × 10 mm = 3 250 mm If you are converting from a smaller unit to a bigger unit, then you divide by 10 each time you move from column to column to a higher unit, for example: •Write 4 000 mm as m. 4 000 mm → 4 000 ÷ 10 cm → 4 000 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 dm = 4 000 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 m = 4 m •Write 500 m as km. 500 m → 500 ÷ 10 Dm → 500 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 Hm = 500 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 km = 5 10 km = 1 2 km Maths_English_LB_Grade6_Book.indb 2882016/12/15 4:21:51 PM GrADe 6: MATheMATiCS [TerM 3] 289 1.

Distances are often rounded to the nearest kilometre. If we buy material for sewing it is usually to the nearest metre. A carpenter can ask for planks to be cut to the nearest centimetre. When we work with lengths, it is convenient to work with full units (km, m, cm, mm). If a length is given in a smaller unit, we often round it off to a bigger unit. If you round off to the nearest 100 cm, it is the same as rounding off to the nearest metre and so on. 28 mm to the nearest centimetre is 3 cm, because 28 mm is 2 8 10 cm. It works like this: when you have a fraction that is less than half, you ignore it. If, however, your fraction is half or more than half, you add one whole. We say 54 cm is more than half a metre and should be rounded up to 1 m. For tenths: ignoreTake as a whole 0123456789 Here are some more examples: 7 4 8 is rounded up to 8 and 7 2 5 is rounded down to 7. We can also round off to other numbers, for example to the nearest 5.

Refiloe changed the calculation in question 2(a) to this: 5 m + 36,5 m + 27 m How far was her answer from the exact answer to question 2(a)? 4. When is it sensible to round off lengths and when not? Discuss this with some of your classmates. When you buy material such as fabric, rope, wire or planks, you will usually round up instead of down to the nearest multiple of 5, 10, 100 or 1 000 of the measuring unit. For example, if you need 73 cm ribbon, you will not round 73 cm off to 70 cm; you will round it up to 75 cm or to 80 cm – otherwise you will buy too little. 5.

Most classrooms have the shape of a rectangular prism. When you are inside a classroom and you look up, you may see the roof. Or, you may see the ceiling which is on top of the walls underneath the roof. Ceilings are normally painted white, but in these pictures the ceiling is green. The ceiling of the classroom is like the top face of a rectangular prism.

People learnt to measure centuries before they learnt how to write and it was through measurement that people learnt to count. Think back about four thousand years. Imagine that you are somewhere in Egypt close to the Nile River. The annual flood has just receded and you have to measure out your land. You also want to build a new house, square in shape, so that you use as little material as possible for a sizeable room. You have to use your body parts as measuring tools and you have the following measuring units at your disposal: cubit: length of the forearm, from the bottom of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger hand: length between the tip of the little finger and the tip of the thumb palm: four fingers across finger: width of a finger The length of the walls of your house must be eight cubits each. You and your father start in one corner, one building the northern wall, and the other the eastern wall. When you have finished, the walls are not the same length! Why is that? To measure your piece of land after the flood, you use another commonly used measuring tool: a length of rope tied in knots at regular intervals. Do you think your neighbours will necessarily be satisfied with the outcome? Why or why not? Of course, these units varied from person to person and this created many difficulties!

Form groups of four and measure: (a) one wall of the classroom in cubits (it must be the same wall) (b) the length of your desk in hands (everyone must measure the same size desk or table) (c) the length of your exercise book in palms (d) the height of a stack of four Mathematics textbooks in fingers. Write the outcomes of the measurements of the different groups in columns on the chalk board. (Keep it there for question 4.) 2. Now have a class discussion about ancient measurement methods and the tools available. 3. What would be the effect on trade and the economy these days if each country manufactured mechanical, electrical and other goods according to their own specific measuring units? How was it possible that the ancient Egyptians could build pyramids, palaces and tombs with such differences regarding units of measurement? They standardised them. By 2500 BCE, a royal cubit of black granite had become the master (standard) cubit. All measuring sticks (cubit sticks) used in Egypt had to be the same length as the master cubit and this was checked regularly. The table on the next page shows how long the Egyptian units were in modern metric lengths. Use these measurements to answer question 4.

A Greek cubit, also called “short cubit” or “small cubit”, was 4 fingers (1 palm) shorter than a royal cubit. With Greece being one of the southern European countries, the Greeks not only traded with the Egyptians but they also exchanged ideas on mathematics. Most countries, however, had their own ways of measuring. Through many years, and through a complicated transformation, it seems that the measurements inch, foot, and yard evolved from the ancient Egyptian units. Interestingly enough, a length of about one foot could be found in the length measurement of most countries. More than 200 years ago the metric system was adopted by France. It was the beginning of the international metric system. Instead of having a large number of units of different sizes, it was decided to use multiples of 10 for longer measurements and decimal fractions for smaller measurements. Today the metric system is used all over the world, except in America and a few small countries. The metre is the “cornerstone” of the metric system. The word “metre” comes from a Greek word which means “a measure”.

Nkhangweleni says: To make an enlargement of a polygon, you just add the same length to all the side lengths, for example 16 units. Rebecca disagrees: No, if you do that the shape will change as well, not just the size. To make an enlargement that keeps the shape you have to multiply all the side lengths by the same number, for example by 3. Write your opinion on this matter. You may refer to this diagram. Rectangle C above is called an enlargement of Rectangle A, because it has the same shape as Rectangle A. Rectangle B is larger than Rectangle A, but it is not called an enlargement, because it has a different shape. Rectangle A is called a reduction of Rectangle C. 2.

Write down all the other possible outcomes. (b) Suppose you subtract the smaller number from the bigger number in each case. What are all the possible results when you subtract the numbers on the two dice? How to play the Subtraction Game Play with a classmate. You each need a die. Each player chooses a set of three numbers from the possible results, for example: 0, 4, 5 or 1, 2, 3 Rules: Each player rolls his or her die. Look at the numbers on the dice and subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. If the difference is 0, 4 or 5, the player who chose these numbers scores one point. If the difference is 1, 2 or 3, the player who chose these numbers scores the point. The game ends after 12 rounds; that is, after you have rolled your dice 12 times. The player with the most points wins the game. 2. Play the Subtraction Game 10 times. (a) Do you think the rules of the game are fair? Why do you say so?

Use the table you completed in question 3 to make a pictograph that shows the number of ways in which each of the eleven results (totals) can be obtained. For example, the result 5 can be obtained in four different ways. x x x x 23456789101112 Possible outcomes: roll two dice and add the numbers 5. Work with a classmate. Make fair rules for an addition game and write them down. 6. Play your addition game 10 times to test it out. Are 10 times enough times to play to decide if your rules are fair? Why do you say so? There are 11 possible results (totals) in the Addition Game. They are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. There are 36 different ways to get the results. The 36 ways are the possible outcomes of the game. rules that are fair give both players an equal chance to win the game each time they play.

NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 42018/05/02 3:57:56 PM Welcome to Grade 6 Natural Sciences and Technology! Join the Quantum Club on an adventure to explore the world around us. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 52018/05/02 3:57:57 PM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hi there! My name is Mothusi. My favourite subjects at school are where I get to be creative and imaginative. But, did you know, this is not only in the art or drama classroom? We can also be creative in the ways we do Science and Technology. This is especially true when thinking about new ways to answer a question with a Science investigation or drawing a design to solve a problem. I also really love being outdoors in the natural world around me. This is why I am going to go through Life and Living and Processing with you. I think we are very lucky to live in such a beautiful place as South Africa, with so many colours and plants and animals. I am excited to learn about photosynthesis and ecosystems. Felicity is my best friend and she teaches me how to think carefully and solve problems using logic, which is a very good skill to have in Science. Although we can get on each other’s nerves, just like best friends do, we have so much fun together and learn a lot from each other. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 62018/05/02 3:57:59 PM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hey! My name is Walt. I have two places where I am most happy! The first is in the Science lab because this is where we get to be inventive and tinker away with projects and experiments! My second favourite place is the kitchen! Do you know how many interesting substances you can find there? I use these substances in my experiments. This is why I am really excited to be going through Matter and Materials and Processing with you. We are going to learn more about the materials around us, and especially about mixtures and solutions. I also really enjoy Maths and thinking about how we can solve problems logically. Phumlani is one of my best mates, although he can be very messy at times! But, Phumlani helps me get involved with my whole body when trying to solve problems in our daily lives, and not just use my mind. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 72018/05/02 3:58:00 PM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. What’s up! My name is Phumlani. I just want to dive straight into this year, and especially Natural Sciences and Technology. Sometimes though, I find it hard to sit still in class as I just want to get up and do things! My teacher often says I have too much energy and I battle to sit still in class. Maybe that’s why I am going through Energy and Change with you this year. I am really looking forward to learning about electric circuits and mains electricity! And, we also get to make an electric circuit this year. The best part about Natural Sciences and Technology is that we get to learn actively. We have goals and questions that we want to answer and I am always the first to leap into action! Walt and I make a very good team because he is very good at thinking and planning, and then following a method. But I think I can also help as sometimes Walt wants to think too much, whereas in Science and Technology you also have to get involved in the subject and start experimenting. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 82018/05/02 3:58:02 PM Hello! I am Mitsi the Meerkat. I love being outside in nature. Learning about plants and animals is my favourite part of Natural Sciences and Technology. I will be going through Life and Living with you. Together we will explore the natural world and the wonderful things that live on our planet. Hello! My name is Felicity. One of my favourite places to be is in the school library. I love reading a new book – there is just so much to learn and discover about our world! I am always asking questions. Often these questions do not yet have answers to them! This is fascinating as we then get to make a theory about what we think the answer might be. This is why I really enjoy learning about outer space as there is so much that we do not know. Throughout history people have been asking questions about space and our place in the universe. This is why I am going to go through Earth and Beyond and Systems and Control with you as we learn more about our planet Earth and our solar system. I also like expressing my opinion and debating about a topic. You have to give me a very good argument to convince me of your opinion! I love exploring with Mothusi as she helps me to be more creative and imaginative in the way that I think. I can also be quite sceptical and do not believe everything I read. But, this is very important in Science as we must not always accept everything as fact.

They make food for themselves and every animal on Earth using sunlight energy, water and carbon dioxide. They also recycle the air and make oxygen for us to breathe. QUESTIONS 1. What happens in a factory? Why do you think we can say plants are like factories? 2. Why can we say that plants make food for themselves and every animal on earth? Scientists have found out exactly how plants are able to do all these things. Let’s take a closer look at how plants make food for themselves and us. The process of photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to change the energy from sunlight into energy for food. Plants change light energy from the sun into food energy. Photosynthesis happens in all green parts of a plant. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 42018/05/02 3:58:04 PM 5Chapter 1: Photosynthesis5 Leaves are usually the greenest parts. So plants do this mostly in their leaves. Light energy Water Oxygen C a r b o n d i o x i d e Do you remember learning about photosynthesis in Grade 5? Plants need certain elements to photosynthesise. There are some important requirements for photosynthesis to happen: 1. Chlorophyll: Chlorophyll is a green substance that plants use to capture light energy from the sun. Chlorophyll is very important. Without chlorophyll plants cannot use the sunlight energy to make food. 2. Sunlight: Sunlight has energy. Plants use this energy to make sugars from water and carbon dioxide. 3. Water: The roots of a plant absorb water and nutrients from the soil. Water is a solvent in all living things. Dissolved substances are moved around the body to where they are needed. Just like you, plants have veins for this movement. They move minerals from the New words • photosynthesis • chlorophyll • solvent • stomata • starch • glucose • molecule • microbes Did you know? The word photosynthesis actually has two parts: photo = light and synthesis = to make or put together. So it means to use light to make something (in this case, food). NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 52018/05/02 3:58:05 PM Life and living and processing6 roots upwards. They move sugars from the leaves downwards. Photosynthesis can only happen in a water solution. Water is also important because it provides support to the plant to keep it upright. Like you, plants have skeletons. But unlike you, many plants have water skeletons! 4. Carbon dioxide: The plant absorbs or takes in carbon dioxide from the air through little holes called stomata. Stomata are found all over the plant, but mostly under the leaves. 5. Soil: The soil provides mineral nutrients and water for the plant that are essential during photosynthesis. Soil also provides anchorage to the plant, otherwise the plant cannot stand up straight. How does photosynthesis occur? Plants use chlorophyll, sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to make food: • Chlorophyll captures the sunlight energy. • This energy splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen. • The oxygen is released into the air. • The hydrogen is used with the carbon dioxide to make glucose (sugars). • The sugars are moved from the leaves to other parts of the plants where they are stored. • The water in the plant veins carries the sugars. When the sugars reach the storage parts they are changed into starch. • Plants can store the starch in these places: –leaves (cabbage, spinach, lettuce) –fruit (apples, banana, peaches) –stem (sugar cane) –seeds (wheat and mealies) –flowers (nasturtiums, broccoli, cauliflower) –roots (carrots and beetroot) Did you know? Scientists have a term for substances like chlorophyll that have a colour. They call them pigments. There are other pigments in plants. Can you think of their colours? There are pigments in your body too! Where do you find them? What do they do? Did you know? Stomata also allow other gasses and water to enter or leave the plant. They do the same job as your mouth and nose when you breath! It is the same job that the pores in your skin do when you sweat! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 62018/05/02 3:58:05 PM 7Chapter 1: Photosynthesis7 Here is a simple illustration to show how this process occurs: energy from sunlight photosynthesis carbon dioxide from the air water and mineral salts from the soil oxygen goes back into the air The process of photosynthesis Don’t you think this all sounds very technical?

Your teacher will explain to you how to act out the process of photosynthesis. 2. Characters needed for this dramatisation: • Narrator to describe the process. This can be a teacher or a learner. It might be a good idea to make short notes from the information on page 6, to remember in what order everything is happening. • Sun – this learner can dress in yellow. Perhaps get some old tin foil or shiny paper to decorate your head or body to show the light and heat energy that the sun produces. • Plants – a few learners can dress in green and perhaps tie a few strings to their feet to represent roots. They need to hold some rice or shiny glitter in their hands or their pockets to show that the water evaporates after photosynthesis. • Rain or water – a few learners can dress in blue and perhaps have some rice, shiny glitter, small pieces of tin foil or something similar to represent the rain falling. • Carbon dioxide – attach signs to the learners’ chests that say ‘Carbon dioxide’ and dress in purple. • Oxygen – attach signs to the learners’ chests that say ‘Oxygen’ and dress in orange. • Glucose energy – learners dress as fruit and vegetables. Dress up or make posters from scrap cardboard to show large carrots, apples, potatoes, or something similar. • Animals – who breathe out carbon dioxide and eat the plants. You can make masks out of paper plates and scrap cardboard. QUESTIONS: 1. Why do plants die when there is a drought? 2. Design a poster for your Grade 4 friends to explain the process of photosynthesis to them. You can use sentences and short paragraphs but make sure you use many illustrations. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 82018/05/02 3:58:05 PM 9Chapter 1: Photosynthesis9 1.2 Food from photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process inside plants that changes the energy from the sun’s light into a form of energy that animals can eat and use to carry out their life processes. Plants changes the glucose into starch, for example mealies (mealies and maize flour), rice (rice flour and rice) and wheat (flour). Plants then store this food in different plant structures, which animals will eat. They can store it in their leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits or seeds. QUESTIONS Look at the photos below of different plant products. For each photo, identify which part of that plant we eat. (For example: When we eat an apple, are we eating the leaf, the stem, the root, the fruit or the seed of the plant?) Draw a table for your answers.

Let’s now find out what the difference is. ACTIVITY 1.2: What is the difference between starch and sugar? MATERIALS: • Maize flour (mealie meal) • Flour • Cooked rice, potato and bread • Glucose sweets • Sugar • Sugar cane (if possible) • Fresh fruit • Blindfold • Clipboard NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 102018/05/02 3:58:07 PM 11Chapter 1: Photosynthesis11 INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in pairs. One partner must be blindfolded. 2. On a piece of paper list the numbers 1–10. 3. The other partner must let the blindfolded partner taste each of the foods marked 1–10. If it is flour, use a teaspoon to spoon the flour into your partner’s mouth. If it is a kernel like a rice or mealie kernel, or a cube of fruit, put it in the palm of their hand and let them eat it themselves. 4. After each taste your blindfolded partner must guess if it is a sugar or a starch based on the taste. 5. Record your partner’s answers on the piece of paper containing the numbers 1–10. Swap with your partner and repeat the test. QUESTIONS: 1. Was it easy to distinguish between the sugar and the starch each time? Which foods did you find difficult to classify? 2. What can you say about the difference between a starch and a sugar based on taste? Iodine starch test Using taste to check if a food is a sugar or a starch is not very reliable. There is a special test that scientists use to see if a food product is a starch or not. It is called the iodine starch test. Iodine solution is a special solution that is normally a brown liquid. When iodine solution is dropped on starch, the iodine and starch combine and produce a blue colour. We use this to test whether there is starch in a food product. Let’s see how this works! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 112018/05/02 3:58:07 PM Life and living and processing12 ACTIVITY 1.3: The iodine starch test IMPORTANT!: There will be no tasting in this activity. MATERIALS: • Iodine • Same foods used in the taste test (they should be marked 1–10) • Include some other foods, such as cheese and a boiled egg INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Copy the table below in your exercise books and complete it following the instructions below. 2. Write the food or plant product that you chose in the first column. 3. You are going to test whether this food product is a starch or not. When the iodine solution turns blue-black you will know it is a starch. 4. Use a dropper and drop iodine solution onto each food group. 5. Put a ✓ next to the food product that turns blue- black – this is a starch. Put a ✗ next to the food product that stays brown – this is not a starch.

Which test do you think is more accurate to test for starch – the taste test or the iodine starch test? 2. Did the animal products, such as cheese and boiled egg, contain starch? Why do you think so? 1.3 Plants and air All animals and plants need oxygen to live and carry out their life processes. Animals take in oxygen throughout the day and night, and breathe out carbon dioxide. Oxygen releases energy from food inside the body for the life processes. QUESTIONS Do you remember what the seven life processes of living things are? Write them down. Plants use oxygen throughout the day and night, like every other living creature. Oxygen is used for plant growth and the development of new plants, seeds, leaves and shoots for example. Therefore, they also produce carbon dioxide as a waste product once the oxygen has been used. Plants do not photosynthesise through the night because there is no sunlight energy available to do that. So they only need carbon dioxide during the day for photosynthesis. New words • cell • waste product • cycle • organic • inorganic NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 132018/05/02 3:58:07 PM Life and living and processing14 This cycle of oxygen production and use, and carbon dioxide use and production, is very important to life on Earth. ACTIVITY 1.4: The oxygen and carbon dioxide cycle INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Carefully study the following illustration. 2. Answer the questions that follow. Carbon dioxide used by plants Oxygen used by animals Oxygen from food-making process available to animals Carbon dioxide given out by fish available to plants Carbon dioxide given off by decaying leaves 1 2 The oxygen and carbon dioxide cycle NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 142018/05/02 3:58:08 PM 15Chapter 1: Photosynthesis15 QUESTIONS: 1. Make a list of living organisms that produce both oxygen and carbon dioxide in this picture. 2. Identify three living organisms that cannot produce oxygen in this picture. 3. Predict what you think would happen if all the animals were removed from this habitat. 4. What two life processes are involved in the carbon dioxide and oxygen cycle? 5. Complete this cycle by filling in the missing information for the two arrows on the left hand side of the illustration. Supply full labels for arrows 1 and 2. 6. Explain why animals would not survive if all the plants on Earth were to suddenly die. 7. Why do we say that oxygen and carbon dioxide are in a cycle? KEY CONCEPTS • Plants produce their own food (glucose) by a process called photosynthesis. • Photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. • During photosynthesis the plant uses chlorophyll, sunlight energy, carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere) and water to make glucose. • Plants change some of the glucose (sugar) into starch, which they store in their leaves, stems and roots, flowers, fruits and seeds. • Animals take in oxygen from the air and produce carbon dioxide when they breathe. • Plants recycle carbon dioxide and make oxygen during the process of photosynthesis. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 152018/05/02 3:58:08 PM Life and living and processing16 REVISION 1. List the four things that are vitally important for plants and photosynthesis. 2. Choose words from the word box to complete the following sentences. Write the sentences out in full. • organic and inorganic material • photosynthesis • water • air • roots • sand and rocks a. The process when the green parts of plants make food is named . b. Water and minerals are absorbed by the of plants. c. Soil is made up of , , , . 3. The seedlings that were planted in the newspaper cuttings or cotton wool did not grow very well at all, even though they had sunlight and water. What could they not get from the newspaper or cotton wool that plants normally get from soil? 4. Where does photosynthesis usually take place? Explain your answer. 5. Do you think photosynthesis takes place at night? Explain your answer. 6. What is the name given to the sugar that plants produce during photosynthesis? 7. What do plants store glucose as? List some places where it is stored. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 162018/05/02 3:58:08 PM 17 2 Nutrients in food KEY QUESTIONS • Why do I have to eat so many different things – why can’t I just eat what I like? • I have heard that people say: “You are what you eat”. What does that mean? • What is so bad about sugary sweets – why shouldn’t I eat lots of them? • What is the difference between a fat and an oil? 2.1 Food groups All living plants and animals need to feed or eat to give them energy to carry out the life processes. Plants make their own food from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis. Animals cannot make their own food, and need to eat plants or other animals to get energy. People also have to eat plant or animal products to get energy to grow and develop. Classification of food groups The food we eat can be grouped or classified into different types or groups. We call these food groups. There are four main food groups and each food group does a different job in the body: • Carbohydrates • Proteins • Fats and oils • Vitamins and minerals New words • carbohydrates • proteins • sodium • calcium • insulate • vitamins • immune system • phosphate • additives NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 172018/05/02 3:58:08 PM Life and living and processing18 Carbohydrates Proteins Lipids – fats and oils Examples of the foods in the food groups, carbohydrates, proteins and fats and oils. We classify food according to these food groups, although most foods contain a mixture of more than one nutrient group. Let’s look at each food group separately and see why each one is important. 1. Carbohydrates: • They are the most important source of energy for the body. • They store energy for the body. • Carbohydrates are an important part of the body structure. • Foods that contain carbohydrates are: pasta, samp, potatoes, cereal, mealie meal, porridge and bread. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 182018/05/02 3:58:08 PM 19Chapter 2: Nutrients in food19 BreadRice PastaPotatoes 2. Proteins: • Proteins are the building blocks for our body – they build the body’s muscles. • They also help to repair hurt or broken tissue. • Proteins can be used as reserve energy if there is a shortage of carbohydrates. • Foods that contain proteins are: meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans, milk and cheese. • Protein is also found in many plant products: chickpeas, beans, lentils, nuts and soya.

Vitamins and minerals: • Vitamins and minerals are essential to the human body and yet we produce very few of them ourselves. • Many important minerals are contained in the food we eat. Two of the most important are sodium and calcium: –Sodium helps to keep the correct balance of water in the body and is found in most food except fruit. –Calcium is important for strengthening bones and teeth. Calcium can be found in fish, green vegetables, milk and cheese. • Most vitamins are manufactured by plants, so we get vitamins from the food we eat or from vitamin supplements. • There are specific foods that contain specific vitamins. • The next table shows some important vitamins, their natural sources and/or the foods that contains them, and some of their functions in the human body. Name of vitaminSourcesFunctions Vitamin A Egg yolk, liver, deep-yellow and deep-green fruits and vegetables, fish liver oils Enables the eyes to produce a pigment that helps us to see in dim light. Vitamin B Brown rice, wholewheat bread There are several types of vitamin B and they have many functions, e.g. they are important in the chemical reactions of breathing. Vitamin C Citrus fruit, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers Strengthens the body’s immune system by increasing its ability to fight infections. Vitamin D Egg yolk, fish liver oils Can be made in the skin when the ultraviolet rays from the sun convert cholesterol in the skin to vitamin D. Helps the absorption of calcium and phosphate. These nutrients are used for the making of strong bones and teeth.

ACTIVITY 2.1: Classify foods into the different food groups MATERIALS: Collect wrappers and packaging material, like boxes and tins, of the foods you eat and bring them to school. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work in groups. Choose the three foods that you think are the most healthy to eat from the wrappers and boxes that you have in your group. 2. Write a reason next to each of these three choices for why you think they are really healthy. 3. Locate the list of ingredients on each food container. You should have at least ten different containers. (If you have too few, swap with another group when they are finished with theirs.) 4. Sort the different foods into the main food groups. 5. Copy the table below in your exercise book and record your work. CarbohydratesProteinsLipidsVitamins and minerals Additives Very often food manufacturers add different preservatives, flavourings and colourings, as well as salt and sugar, to make the food look or taste more attractive to their customers. These are called additives.

NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 232018/05/02 3:58:11 PM Life and living and processing24 After doing this activity, did you notice a difference between foods which are naturally occurring (such as meat and vegetables) and foods which have been processed? The natural foods contained a mixture of more than one nutrient group. For example, nuts are a source of protein and fat. Milk is a source of calcium and protein. Vegetables contain many nutrient groups. The foods which have been processed, or manufactured, often contained additives, such as salt, sugar, preservatives and flavourings. Let’s have a look at some different meals to see if we have all the food groups. ACTIVITY 2.3: Sorting foods in a meal into the food groups INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Below are pictures of five different meals. 2. Study each meal and classify each food on the plate into one of the food groups (protein, carbohydrates, fats and oils, vitamins and minerals). 3. Remember, some foods may fall under more than one food group. 4. In your exercise books, write out each food in the meal in a table, and write the food group it belongs to next to it.

The next step is to see what amounts of each food group we need to eat regularly to stay healthy. This is called a balanced diet. What is a diet? QUESTION Discuss the word ‘diet’ with your class and come up with a definition for this word. Write it down in your exercise books. Food pyramids A food pyramid provides a guide to a healthy balanced diet. It shows how to classify food types into different levels. A balanced healthy diet will include servings from each level of the food pyramid and will show the correct quantities you need to eat: • You need to eat a little of the food at the top. (oils, sweets, etc.) New words • nutrition • pyramid • balanced diet • dairy products NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 282018/05/02 3:58:12 PM 29Chapter 3: Nutrition29 • You should eat less meat, chicken, fish and dairy products than vegetables and fruit. • The food in the middle of the pyramid, fruit and vegetables, must also be eaten in fair amounts. • You need to eat more of the food at the bottom of the pyramid. (breads, pastas, rices, etc.) Here is an example of a food pyramid: Fats and oils Milk and dairy products Fruits and vegetables Cereals and starch Meat, fish and eggs Sugar Some people eat a very unhealthy diet and turn the food pyramid upside down! They eat far more sweets, cakes, fatty rich food and far less vegetables and starches! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 292018/05/02 3:58:12 PM Life and living and processing30 Mmm... I think I have a very balanced diet and I love being healthy! But I am not so sure about my brother. I kept a record of what he ate for a week. ACTIVITY 3.1: Evaluating a diet INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Carefully study Rajesh’s weekly diet. 2. Answer the questions that follow. BreakfastLunchSupper Monday Toast with peanut butter, coffee with milk and three teaspoons of sugar Two-minute noodles, cream soda, jelly (while watching TV) Spaghetti bolognese (with chopped carrots in the mince) with cheese sprinkled on top, fruit juice, tea with milk and two teaspoons of sugar NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 302018/05/02 3:58:13 PM 31Chapter 3: Nutrition31 BreakfastLunchSupper Tuesday Toast with peanut butter, coffee with milk and three teaspoons of sugar Two-minute noodles, Coke, toast with peanut butter, popcorn (while watching TV) Mom and Dad worked late – scrambled egg on toast with baked beans, coffee with milk and three teaspoons of sugar Wednesday Late for school – didn’t eat Two eggs and toast with cheese, tea with milk and three sugars, more toast with jam and peanut butter later (while watching TV) Hawaiian pizza, coke, cream soda, chocolate milkshake Thursday Toast with peanut butter, coffee with milk and three teaspoons of sugar Indoor hockey practice after school – pie from tuckshop, coke, a chocolate, packet of hot chips Roast chicken, butternut, baked potatoes, salad, fruit juice, coffee with milk and one teaspoon of sugar Friday Toast with butter (peanut butter is finished), coffee with milk and three teaspoons of sugar Band practice after school – pie from tuckshop, coke, sweets Takeaway chicken in a bucket, hot chips, coke, tea with milk and three teaspoons of sugar, popcorn QUESTIONS: 1. Reading only this table showing Rajesh’s weekly diet, do you think he has a balanced diet? Why do you think so? 2. Now let’s use our knowledge of a food pyramid to see how healthy Rajesh’s diet for the week was. Use the tallying method to keep score of everything he ate: To tally up results you make one line down for every item you count and when you get to the fifth item you draw a diagonal line through the other four. That makes it easy to count in fives and count the few left over at the end.

List the times and days when Rajesh ate fruit or vegetables. 4. What important food group is Rajesh missing from his diet if he does not eat enough fruit and vegetables? 5. Can you predict what will happen if Rajesh continues with this diet? 6. Now that you have tallied up the different food groups that Rajesh ate in a week, do you think he ate a balanced diet? Why do you say so? 7. Do you think Rajesh is a very active person? Why do you say so? 8. Takeaways are known for being fatty and oily because restaurants often deep fry the food. Rajesh and Mothusi’s family ate takeaways twice in the week and the mom cooked twice. Compare the cooked meals with the takeaways, specifically focusing on the amount of oil used to prepare the meals. 9. What advice would you tell Mothusi to give to her brother? 10. Now that you have completed this activity, explain why different portions of the different food groups are necessary for a balanced diet. ACTIVITY 3.2: Comparing meals INSTRUCTIONS: 1. On the next page are photographs of different meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 2. One of the meal options is unhealthy and the other is healthy. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 322018/05/02 3:58:13 PM 33Chapter 3: Nutrition33 3. Choose the healthier option and write a paragraph explaining why. List the food groups that are missing from the unhealthy option, compared to the food groups that are present in the healthy option. Breakfast: Option 1: Fruit loops Option 2: Fruit salad Option 1: Oats with raspberries Option 2: Flapjacks with syrup Lunch: Option 1: Egg salad Option 2: Fried chips NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 332018/05/02 3:58:14 PM Life and living and processing34 Option 1: Hamburger Option 2: Omelette with salad Supper: Option 1: Chicken pieces Option 2: Beef, peas and rice 3.2 Diseases caused by an unhealthy diet There are many people in the world that do not or are not able to eat a healthy, balanced diet. Many choose to eat an unhealthy diet while others do not have a choice. Many people live in cities and can afford to buy takeaways often, or to eat hastily prepared meals, which do not always include foods from the four food groups. Remember the food pyramid we saw before? On page 35 is a picture of the food pyramid of someone with an unhealthy diet.

QUESTIONS Discuss in your class why you think this kind of food pyramid is unhealthy. Compare it to the healthy food pyramid on page 29 and write down the differences in your workbook. Other families have to eat what they can afford. They do not have the privilege of choosing what their food pyramid looks like, but eat what they can buy with their small incomes. This would mostly consist of carbohydrates and some vegetables, and rarely includes meat and enough proteins and other vitamins. Let’s look at the causes of a poor, unhealthy diet and then at possible diseases caused by unhealthy diets. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 352018/05/02 3:58:15 PM Life and living and processing36 Causes of a poor diet There are many causes of a poor diet. 1. Diseases and infections: When someone has a chronic illness, such as HIV/Aids, they are sick for a very long time. Their bodies become weak and they cannot take in nourishment from the food they manage to eat, resulting in a poor diet. 2. Dietary practices: In many countries, people have a preference for certain foods, for example rice, samp or mealie meal. People eat a lot of this particular food type and do not get enough protein or fats and oils in their diet. They also often cannot afford other food types, especially in developing countries. However, some families in developed countries do not eat enough fruit and vegetables out of choice, and eat a lot of refined carbohydrates, which also leads to disease and illness. 3. Poverty and high food prices: Poverty and high food prices stop many people from enjoying foods such as milk, meat, poultry (like chicken) and fruits. This has made it almost impossible for poor families to afford certain food groups. Some families can only afford one type of food group. 4. Food shortage: Sometimes famine occurs in a country where drought, poor farming knowledge and skill, and a lack of technology limits the yield of crops and herds of animals. This results in a food shortage in that country. In these situations, people will eat whatever food is available to them, often leading to an unhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can lead to many health problems because the body does not get the right amount of the different food groups, and therefore cannot function properly. Some diseases and conditions Often we get diseases and conditions because our bodies do not get the necessary nourishment. Some of these diseases are: • Tooth decay: When you eat or drink too much sugar, the bacteria in your mouth makes acids that eat away at the tooth surface (called enamel), and causes cavities to form. Did you know? A balanced diet also means drinking water throughout the day! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 362018/05/02 3:58:15 PM 37Chapter 3: Nutrition37 Too many sweets can cause cavities to form in your teeth. 1 Remember to brush your teeth to help prevent tooth decay! 2 • Rickets: This is a condition mostly seen in babies and children. When children do not get enough fruit and vegetables, and do not get enough Vitamin D, their bodies cannot absorb calcium and they cannot grow strong bones. • Constipation: This is a painful condition (not a disease) that occurs when bowel movements become difficult and take place days or even weeks apart. An unhealthy diet is often to blame, but there are other causes too. The best way to treat constipation is to eat a healthy diet with lots of fibre in the carbohydrates, to exercise regularly and to drink plenty of water. • Obesity: This is a condition (not a disease) where a person’s body weight is more than 20% that of the average weight for other people the same age and height as that person. The best prevention for obesity is to follow a healthy, balanced diet. Obesity is a condition which is becoming more common all around the world. 3 Visit e.tv news story on obesity in South Africa. goo.gl/h6MgU NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 372018/05/02 3:58:15 PM Life and living and processing38 • Diabetes: This is a disease that affects the body’s ability to use blood sugar for energy. Diabetes symptoms may include an increased thirst and urination, blurred vision and excessive tiredness. • Anorexia nervosa: This is life-threatening eating disorder where the patients starve themselves and deprives their bodies of nourishment to cause themselves to lose a large amount of weight. • Kwashiorkor: This is a disease that affects many children. It is caused by a lack of protein and iodine in their diet. Children suffering from this may have swollen hands and feet, and especially a very large stomach, many ulcers on the skin and their hair might discolour. ACTIVITY 3.3: Identify possible diseases and conditions What diseases or symptoms could Mothusi’s brother, Rajesh, develop from his diet? INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Carefully read through Rajesh’s diet again. 2. Evaluate his activities in the afternoon as well. 3. Use the information about these diseases and disorders and suggest possible diseases or conditions that Rajesh might develop if he does not change his diet drastically.

People have been processing food for thousands of years. Before the invention of fridges and freezers, people had to collect food in summer and store it because in winter food is often scarce. They found out that they could preserve food like meat and fish by salting and spicing, and then drying it – this is called curing the meat. In South Africa biltong and bokkoms are examples of cured meat and fish.

You may not take anything non-organic with you. So no metal tins or plastic containers, and certainly no computers, cell phones or laptops! Imagine being transported 350 years back into history and arriving with only the clothes you are wearing and whatever you have learnt in your head in exactly the same place you are right now. It is late summer and you need to spend a year wherever you are and survive until the wormhole opens again at that exact spot and allows you to return to ‘the future’. Your mission: Gather information on the local inhabitants and the food they eat, their ways of living, and how they survive the elements and natural dangers in their environment. When you return you will need to explain how they preserved and processed different foods to last them through winter. How did they package and protect this food from scavenging animals and pesky insects? Brainstorm these problems with your group. List as many different questions or problems that you can think of that will affect you: • Immediately • In about a month’s time • In six months’ time • Right at the end of your stay – a week or so before you return to the present time. Come on! Follow the Quantum Club and go back in time! Did you know? Biltong was invented by the Voortrekkers who travelled by ox-wagon during the Great Trek. They needed to preserve meat for the long journey. The raw meat was preserved using salt, vinegar and spices. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 422018/05/02 3:58:16 PM 43Chapter 4: Food processing43 Think especially of food and shelter, and specifically how you will collect, preserve and process any food that you collect. Remember you are not allowed to take anything that is not organic so no pocket knives, nylon rope or even lighters can go with you! Design: Design the following items, which you can make and use when you land: 1. Something that you can collect and carry water in, and store it in for future use. 2. Something that you can collect and carry food in, and specifically something that you can store it in to keep it away from scavenging animals and insects. 3. Something that you can use to cut with, as you will need to make a shelter to sleep in and keep safe from wild animals. You will also need to cut material for your food and water containers. 4. Something that you can use to hunt animals or catch fish, if you are going to eat meat while you are there. 5. A device that you can use to preserve meat or fish, or perhaps fruit and vegetables for the winter months. Give each person in your group one of these items to design and make, and bring to class. Make sure you do not use any modern tools, or any metal, glass or plastic. QUESTIONS: 1. List the possible dangers that you will face in your new home. 2. Can you predict how the locals will look and how they will treat you? 3. Describe your first night there. 4. Explain how you will decide what you can and cannot eat on your first day. 5. Complete this sentence: If I want to preserve some of the fish I catch I will ... 6. The local indigenous people use different methods to preserve their fresh fruit and vegetables. Find out about these methods and use one method to preserve some fruit of your own. At the end of this chapter, bring your preserved fruit to show the class. You have two weeks. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 432018/05/02 3:58:16 PM Life and living and processing44 Food processing – then and now Hundreds of years ago explorers like Columbus, Da Gama and Diaz, had to pack supplies for their crews to last a very long time should they not find food and water on their expeditions. They too had to take as many preserved food and drink as they could. Many of the foods we eat today cannot be eaten in their raw form – we need to process the food to make it edible. Sometimes food is also processed to add to its nutritional value. For example, when we ferment dairy products to make yogurt, cheese and buttermilk. QUESTIONS 1. There are many reasons to process food. Can you think of any? Write them down. 2. When you get home today ask your parents, family members and maybe your friends’ parents if they think processed food is good or bad, and why they say so. Write the results of what you learnt from this quick survey in your exercise book. Benefits of food processing Food processing adds many benefits to our modern lives: • Transportation of fresh food is quite difficult. If producers can process the fresh fruit and vegetables in some way, the food is easier to transport. Delicate products like grapes, strawberries and peaches can be transported much easier. The processing also helps the fruit and vegetables to last longer. • Today people can eat fresh fruit and vegetables all year round. They do not depend on seasonal availability because of modern methods to process and transport these products. Therefore food processing and transportation makes the modern balanced and varied diet possible. Did you know? In the 1790s, Napoleon Bonaparte launched a competition in France for scientists to develop ways to preserve foods for France’s armies! This led to the invention of canning. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 442018/05/02 3:58:16 PM 45Chapter 4: Food processing45 This truck collects the pear and apple boxes and transports them. • Many times food and beverage producers add extra vitamins and nutrients to their food to make it healthier for their clients. • Buying and preparing processed food is also more convenient and less time-consuming. • Foods are processed to preserve them, such as when fruits are preserved to make jam, or pickled, such as pickled onions. This ginger has been pickled and preserved so that it lasts longer.

An allergy for cow or goat milk is a very common allergy among small children. They are able to drink ‘milk’ only because modern food processing has found a way to make milk from rice, oats or soya. Rice or soya milk are processed foods and an alternative to cow’s milk for people with allergies. ACTIVITY 4.2: Describing processed foods INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the following photographs of various foods. 2. Each one has either been processed in some way, or needs to be processed before we can eat it. 3.

QUESTION Write down some possible reasons why people think processed food is not good for you. ACTIVITY 4.3: Class discussion INSTRUCTIONS: 1. We are going to have a class discussion about some of the possible drawbacks of processed foods and why some people do not like the idea. 2. This is an opportunity for you to practice taking down notes from what was said in class. 3. Your teacher will lead the discussion and also write some things on the board. 4. You must take notes in your exercise books. 4.2 How are foods processed? There are different levels of food processing. The key question is to ask: Has any process occurred from when this plant or animal was in its natural habitat to where it is now? If you can say yes then you know that it has been processed in some way or another. Minimally processed foods: • Fruit and vegetables, nuts, meat and milk undergo very little processing from when the plant or animal product was in its natural state to the point where it lands on your table. New words • curdle • shelf-life • commercial NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 492018/05/02 3:58:19 PM Life and living and processing50 • They need to harvested, washed and sometimes peeled, chopped, juiced or cut to remove inedible parts, before they are sold. These have a very short shelf-life. • Animal products like eggs and milk must be collected or harvested from the animals, while meat products need butchering. Milk and juice are minimally processed. Vegetables are washed, cut and cooked. This is minimal processing. Processed food ingredients: • Products with a longer shelf-life, like flours, oils, fats, sugars, syrups, margarine, sweeteners and starches, fall into this category. • The original product has been changed and the ingredient does not look like the original kernel or grain, or oil seed or beans. • These processing techniques often break down any nutrient values and the manufacturers often add in extra nutrients, vitamins and minerals to their foods. Highly processed foods: • Highly processed foods include snack foods and desserts, biscuits, cereal bars, chips, cakes and pastries, as well as fizzy soft drinks, breads, pastas, breakfast cereals and infant formula. • Animal products that are highly processed include processed meats (smoked, canned, salted or cured), nuggets, fish fingers, viennas, many sausages and boerewors, and burgers. Did you know? The Xhosa people leave milk to curdle in a hide sack or calabash to form a favourite semi-solid sour yoghurt drink. Did you know? The Swazi people make marula beer by placing the ripe fruit in large traditional pots and letting them ferment. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 502018/05/02 3:58:19 PM 51Chapter 4: Food processing51 Polony is a highly processed food. The table below shows how a raw product is processed to make an ingredient, which looks very different to the original raw product. Then the processed ingredients are used to make highly processed foods, such as bread. The raw product: Wheat The processed ingredient: Flour The highly processed food: Bread ACTIVITY 4.4: Learning how to summarise Sometimes we are presented with a lot of information, and we need to condense it to make it easier to remember. This is called summarising and it is a very useful skill. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Draw a table to summarise the information about the levels of food processing. 2. Include a short description of each level of food processing and examples. Did you know? Mealie meal, made by grinding maize, forms a huge part of the diet in many indigenous cultures in southern Africa. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 512018/05/02 3:58:20 PM Life and living and processing52 3. Think about how many columns and rows you will need. 4. Give your table a heading. Food processing methods As you can see, the degree in which food is processed determines many of the processes involved. Processing methods have changed in many ways, but the basic principles are still applied. Food is still dried or heated to preserve it, just like people did 300 years ago, but there are many modern methods that are also used today: • Sun drying, freeze drying and spray drying. • Fermenting barley, grapes or dairy into cheese, buttermilk (amasi) or yogurt. • Pickling vegetables (onions or gherkins, for example). • Salting and spicing meat to preserve it (then drying it). • Adding sugar to berries and/or fruit to make preserves. • Pasteurisation: Using just the right amount of heat to warm up milk or juice for example, to extend the shelf life. • Cooking by roasting, smoking, baking, frying or toasting. • Freezing or refrigerating. • The making of juice concentrates. QUESTIONS When you go home from school today, make a list of the food products that you have at your house (whether they are in the cupboard, the fridge or the freezer). Next to each item, write down the type of processing it might have gone through, using the list above as a guideline. Did you know? Dr J.H. Kellogg invented a type of granola cereal in 1860 – it was meant for Seventh Day Adventists who were following a very strict diet. Later his brother joined him and they started their company Kelloggs! Do you think they were successful? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 522018/05/02 3:58:20 PM 53Chapter 4: Food processing53 No matter what food processing method is used, there are five extremely important performance parameters that all food processing must adhere to: 1. Hygiene 2. Energy efficient 3. Minimal wastage 4. Labour efficient 5. Minimal factory shutdowns QUESTIONS Discuss why you think each of these five points are important in food processing. You might need to do some extra reading and have a class discussion. We have learnt a lot about food processing methods in our modern lives. However, the indigenous people of southern Africa have been preserving and processing food for many generations, and still use some of their traditional methods today. ACTIVITY 4.5: Comparing traditional and commercial food processing methods INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Read the following description of how beer is made in the Zulu culture. 2. Then answer the questions that follow. Zulu beer making Beer (utshwala) forms an integral part of the Zulu culture, especially at social gatherings and traditional ceremonies. Zulu beer is traditionally made by the women. To brew the beer, the women soak coarse sorghum and maize in water for one day, typically in a big drum-like imbiza pot. The following day, the broth is boiled over a fire and more dry sorghum is added to the mixture. After this, the mixture is mashed together and then allowed to cool for the rest of the day. The next day NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 532018/05/02 3:58:20 PM Life and living and processing54 (day 3 of the brewing process), the mixture is filtered through a sieve to remove the big fibres. The sieve is made from palm fronds and the brew is poured from the big imbiza vessel into the serving vessel, iphangela, made from clay. The beer is now ready to be served. The iphangela is carried from brewery in the kraal (a semi-thatched hut that allows the smoke from the fire to escape and ensures a good supply of oxygen to ferment the mixture) to the drinking assembly. A woman scoops the beer into a drinking vessel, ukhamba (a small, round clay pot decorated with traditional patterns) using a dried gourd and presents it on her knees to the men. She will first taste the beer to show the head of the household that she has brewed the beer properly, and then hand him the ukhamba, before passing it around to the rest. The beer contains 3% alcohol and it is nutritious, as it is made from plant products without modern additives or colourants. This watertight, handwoven basket, called iquamba, is used to store any leftover beer. 3 QUESTIONS: 1. What are the ingredients used to make utshwala? 2. What are the Zulu names for the three different pots (vessels) used in the beer-making process? 3. What are these vessels made from? Did you know? The Ndebele people of southern Africa eat a plant called umrorho. It is cooked or dried by spreading it out in the sun so that it can be stored for the cold winter months. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 542018/05/02 3:58:20 PM 55Chapter 4: Food processing55 4. Why does the brewery hut only have a semi-thatched roof and not a fully enclosed roof? 5. Draw a flow diagram to illustrate the Zulu beer-making process. Remember to include arrows to show the direction. 6. For the following task, you need to do some research, using books and the internet. Find out how beer is made in a modern brewery, such as the South African Brewery in Newlands, Cape Town. Write a paragraph where you compare this modern beer-making process to the indigenous method of the Zulu people. You now have a better idea of the different ways that raw food can be processed. Choose one particular method that you found really interesting to further research. Then process the food at the end. ACTIVITY 4.6: Food processing project INSTRUCTIONS: 1. You need to read as much as possible about your chosen method of food processing. 2. You will need to interview at least one person who uses this method of food processing. Before your interview you will need write down at least ten different questions to ask during the interview. Include these questions and the person’s answers in your project’s presentation. 3. After your research and interview you need to include a few paragraphs headed: What I learnt about food processing. This must be a summary of the information you learnt. 4. Present your findings in a visible form that you like – perhaps a poster, PowerPoint slideshow or in a flip-file as a brochure. Be creative and present your information in a lively and interesting way! 5. Use the knowledge and understanding that you gained and process the food using this method. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 552018/05/02 3:58:21 PM Life and living and processing56 6. You will need to do a presentation to the class. Include the steps you followed to process your chosen food. Bring some of your processed food to class so that you can all enjoy what everyone has made. 7. When you choose a processing method make sure you have food that you will be able to process using this method! If you cannot find fresh (raw) peaches to poach because it is winter, then consider choosing another processing method. KEY CONCEPTS • Food is processed to make it edible, by cooking or preparing it for example. • Food is processed to make it last longer – we say to preserve it. • Food is processed to improve its nutritional value by fermenting it for example. • During processing many foods may lose some of their nutrients. • Various methods are used to process food. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 562018/05/02 3:58:21 PM 57Chapter 4: Food processing57 REVISION 1. Write a definition for ‘food processing’ that will explain what it means. 2. There are three main reasons why we process food. Explain what is meant by the following words in relation to food processing: a. preserving b. cooking / frying c. fermenting 3. List three drawbacks why many people believe that food processing is not good for their health. 4. Describe how you would preserve extra fish that you had caught while on an overnight camping trip. 5. A farmer wants to export some green (white) table grapes to Australia from his farm near Worcester in the Western Cape. Suggest the best form of transport that you know of that he should use, and explain why you gave him this advice. 6. The lives of many diabetics and people with severe food allergies have been drastically improved with the invention of many processed foods. Explain why you think this is so. 7. Write the degree to which the raw materials were processed for each item. FoodDegree of processing a. Mealie bread b. Fresh mealies washed and packaged c. Sunflower oil 8. Explain why many people believe that highly processed food is bad for your health. 9. Write a short paragraph summarising what you have learnt about food processing. Why do you think it is important in your daily life? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 572018/05/02 3:58:21 PM Life and living and processing58 I really enjoyed that, especially learning about traditional food processing. I am now going to give my strawberry preserve that I made during our food processing project to my grandmother for her birthday! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 582018/05/02 3:58:22 PM 59 5 Ecosystems and food webs KEY QUESTIONS • What is an ecosystem? • How often does it rain in a rainforest or in a desert? • Now that I know how people eat, how do animals get their food? • Why can animals only eat one type of thing? For example: Why won’t a great white start eating kelp, or why won’t a tortoise hunt a mouse? 5.1 Different ecosystems Nothing in the world can live truly on its own. No plant or animal, and certainly no human. Living things are connected to each other, they depend on each other, and on the non-living things in their environments. In this chapter we will take a closer look at ecosystems and examine the different kinds of ecosystems that we get around the world, see how animals, plants and microorganisms depend on each other, and learn about food webs and feeding relationships in an ecosystem. Types of ecosystems An ecosystem is an area where living and non-living things depend on each other in many different ways. There are many different types of ecosystems on our planet: • Rivers • Mountains • Sea and the rocky shores • Ponds and wetlands New words • ecosystem • tundra • permafrost • savanna • fynbos • biome • dependent • interdependent NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 592018/05/02 3:58:22 PM Life and living and processing60 • Arctic and alpine tundra are in extremely cold regions close to the North and South poles. There are no trees but some shrubs and dwarf plants grow in wet, spongy soil if it is not permanently frozen (they call this permafrost). • Grasslands: tropical savannas and temperate grasslands. • Forests, including tropical rainforests, and forests of coniferous and/or deciduous trees in moderate climates support many kinds of herbivores and carnivores. • Deserts and semi-deserts ACTIVITY 5.1: Describing different ecosystems INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Study the photos of different ecosystems in the table below. 2. Identify the type of ecosystem in each photo. 3. Then write a description of each ecosystem: • Identify some important physical features and structures, such as rivers, mountains, rocks, etc. • What type of climate do you expect where this ecosystem is found? • Identify the types of plants and animals you would expect to find in the ecosystem. Why might they benefit from living in these conditions? EcosystemType of ecosystem and description a. Did you know? In America grasslands are prairies and in Asia they are called steppes. In South America they call it pampas and in South Africa we often call it bushveld or savanna. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 602018/05/02 3:58:22 PM 61Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs61 EcosystemType of ecosystem and description b. c. d. e. f. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 612018/05/02 3:58:23 PM Life and living and processing62 A unique South African ecosystem South Africa’s fynbos region is unique – it produces an incredible array of plants and specifically flowers. Our national symbol, the Protea, grows wild here and nowhere else in the entire world! The king protea, our national flower 1 Typical Fynbos at Cape Point Nature Reserve 2 South Africa is famous for its fynbos. It does not grow naturally anywhere else in the world! Fynbos plants are especially adapted to survive the climatic conditions and frequent fires. The low bushes can survive the harsh windy conditions, and the plants produce seeds that can very often only germinate once they had been scorched by fire. A fire passed through this fynbos area. A year later the indigenous fynbos had regrown but the pine trees that are not indigenous were all dead. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 622018/05/02 3:58:24 PM 63Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs63 The fynbos biome in South Africa has a huge biodiversity in plants and animals. 5.2 Living and non-living things in ecosystems In an ecosystem, there are certain relationships between the living things and the non-living things in a particular area. QUESTIONS 1. What are some of the non-living things in an ecosystem? 2. What does biodiversity mean? A healthy ecosystem is one in which there is a balance between the non-living and living things. A healthy ecosystem also depends on sufficient biodiversity of plants, animals and their habitats. We saw at the beginning of the term that plants depend on air, water and sunlight in order to make their food. Do you remember what this process is called? Animals also depend on the non-living things in their ecosystem. All animals need oxygen from the air to breathe and to drink water. Some animals also use the non-living things to make their shelters. For example, ants rely on the soil and sand to build their nests in. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 632018/05/02 3:58:24 PM Life and living and processing64 ACTIVITY 5.2: Assessing the balance between living and non-living things INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at each of the following photos of different ecosystems in which the balance between living and non-living things has become upset. 2. Answer the questions on each picture. A dried river bed. In this river ecosystem, the water has dried up due to a drought. How does this affect the biodiversity of the plants and animals in this ecosystem? The soil has started to erode. 3 NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 642018/05/02 3:58:24 PM 65Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs65 In this photograph the soil has started to erode. Why do you think this happened? A pine tree plantation In this man-made forest, there is not much life under the canopy of the trees. Why do you think this is so? As you have seen from this activity, the living things depend on the non-living things in an ecosystem. There is also a very fine balance, and if something is upset, then the ecosystem will begin to deteriorate. The importance of water in an ecosystem Without water life as we know it cannot exist. • Water provides a habitat for many different organisms and allows plants and animals to survive and breed. • Water is a universal solvent and allows important chemical reactions to take place. It is a key ingredient for photosynthesis, where plants create glucose (sugars) from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. • Water plays an important role in plant reproduction as some seeds need to be dispersed by water. (Try and remember which seeds get dispersed by water.) NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 652018/05/02 3:58:25 PM Life and living and processing66 Near water On water In water Animals depend on water in their ecosystems. 5.3 Food webs We have now had a look at what makes up an ecosystem and that there are relationships between the living and non-living things. In an ecosystem, plants and animals are also connected to each other due to their feeding relationships. The plants in an ecosystem are called the producers and the animals are the consumers. QUESTIONS Do you remember what a producer and a consumer does in an ecosystem? (From Grade 5 work but also from the photosynthesis work you started this term with.) Write an answer in your exercise books. New words • food web • microorganism • insectivore • field work • environmental disaster NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 662018/05/02 3:58:25 PM 67Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs67 There are different types of consumers: • Herbivores only eat plants and plant products. • Carnivores only eat meat and meat products (eggs). • Omnivores eat plant and animal products. • Insectivores only eat ... Can you guess what? • Scavengers eat dead animal matter. • Decomposers are micro-organisms like bacteria and fungi, as well as mushrooms, that break down animal and plant material into tiny particles, and recycle it into the ground ready for the plant to use. QUESTIONS What do you call a human herbivore? Do you remember in Grade 5 when we looked at food chains? Here is an example of a food chain: Leaf CaterpillarChameleon Mongoose Snake A simple food chain QUESTIONS Work with a friend and design your own food chain consisting of four organisms. Remember a food chain always starts with plants (producers) and ends with decomposers. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 672018/05/02 3:58:25 PM Life and living and processing68 In a whole ecosystem, the feeding relationships between plants and animals are much more complex than a simple food chain. For example, in the food chain on page 67, the chameleon might also eat flies or butterflies. The snake does not only eat chameleons, but also lizards and mice, and the mongoose also eats small birds and eggs. What is a food web? When we join many different food chains in an ecosystem together, we get a food web. A food web consists of many thousands and thousands of food chains that are connected to each other. A food web in a savanna ecosystem is shown below. A food web in a savanna. Visit Food webs (video). goo.gl/qbccF NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 682018/05/02 3:58:26 PM 69Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs69 There are also different levels of consumers in an ecosystem: • Primary consumers are the herbivores that eat the plants, such as the mice and grass in this savanna food web. • Secondary consumers eat primary consumers. • Tertiary consumers eat the secondary or primary consumers. QUESTIONS 1. Study the food web on page 68 again and identify the producers and the consumers. Distinguish between the primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. 2. Below is another food web consisting of plants, fish and birds. What kind of ecosystem do you think this food web describes? A food web consisting of plants, fish and birds. Osprey Gulls and terns Bald eagle Large piscivorous fish Sea ducks Tundra swan Geese Wading birds Zooplankton Invertebrates Phytoplankton Aquatic vegetation Herbivorous duck Vegetation Small planktivorous fish Bivalves NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 692018/05/02 3:58:26 PM Life and living and processing70 ACTIVITY 5.3: Drawing food webs INSTRUCTIONS: Use the following lists of organisms in a sea and forest ecosystem to draw a food web for each ecosystem. 1. Sea ecosystem: phytoplankton, sea weed, zooplankton, crab, lobster (scavenger), prawn, small fish, large fish, turtle, seal, dolphin, killer whale. 2. Forest ecosystem: grass, small plants, seeds, beetle (herbivore), butterfly, tree frog, rabbit, mouse, seed- eating bird, insectivorous bird, snake, fox, owl. Now that we have learned about the living and non-living things in an ecosystem, and the relationships that exist, let’s investigate an ecosystem in or near the school. I love going outside to study the world around us! Come on, let’s go! Did you know? When a scientist, such as a botanist, zoologist or ecologist, goes outside to do their work and experiments, this is called field work. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 702018/05/02 3:58:26 PM 71Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs71 ACTIVITY 5.4: Studying an ecosystem MATERIALS: • Eight sticks • String (about 30 m) • Clipboard • Scrap paper • Pen and pencil • Reference books for identifying species names INSTRUCTIONS: 1. You will work in groups for this activity. Go outside with your teacher and identify an ecosystem on your school grounds, or near to the school, which you can study. 2. You will need to mark out the area with the sticks and string using the quadrant method. Look at the picture below to get an idea of how to set up your quadrant. The area must be 5m x 5m. 3. Once you have marked out the square, divide it up into four smaller squares with the string so that you have a quadrant with four squares as shown in the picture. 5 m5 m A 5m x 5m quadrant 4. When marking out your ecosystem to study, be careful not to damage any of the plants and animals that are there as this is what you will be studying. 5. For each of the four quadrants in your ecosystem, count the number of different species of plants and animals. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 712018/05/02 3:58:26 PM Life and living and processing72 6. See if you can identify the names of the different plant and animal species using reference books. Copy the table below in your exercise books and fill this out when you get back to class. 7. Study the non-living things in your ecosystem. For example, what type of soil is present? Are there any rocks? Is there perhaps a stream running through your ecosystem? What is the sunlight like, shady or full sun? Are there any animal shelters present? Make notes about this as you will have to answer questions when you get back to class. QUESTIONS: 1. What type of ecosystem are you studying? 2. What is the total area of your square? 3. Copy the following table in your exercise books and fill out each quadrant: Quadrant 1Quadrant 2Quadrant 3Quadrant 4 Number of plant species Number of animal species Total organisms in each quadrant 4. What is the average number of plant species in the whole square? (Hint: To work out average, add up the number of plant species for each quadrant and divide by the number of quadrants). 5. What is the average number of animal species? 6. What is the average number of total organisms in your ecosystem? 7. What is the number of organisms per unit of area? This is quite tricky – your teacher might need to help you! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 722018/05/02 3:58:26 PM 73Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs73 8. Copy the table below in your exercise books and fill in the names of three species of plants and three species of animals that you identified. Do a simple drawing of each organism and write a short description of each species. Names of speciesDrawingDescription Plant species: 1: 2: 3: Animal species: 1: 2: 3: 9. Write a description of the non-living things in your ecosystem. Explain the availability of food for the animals, the water availability, the type of soil (sandy or rich organic soil, for example) the amount of sunlight (shady or full sun, for example), and describe if there are any natural shelters for animals. 10. Your ecosystem will contain animals and plants which are interdependent and they are connected by their feeding relationships. Draw a food web for your ecosystem in your exercise books. 11. Ecosystems are often destroyed due to the impact of humans or other environmental disasters, such as a flood or drought. Identify some possible threats to your ecosystem. Write about them in your exercise book and why they could destroy your ecosystem. 12. Brainstorm possible ways to prevent these threats to your ecosystem from destroying it. Record your ideas in your exercise book. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 732018/05/02 3:58:27 PM Life and living and processing74 KEY CONCEPTS • There are different ecosystems where living and non-living things depend on each other. • Living and non-living things share an ecosystem. • Food webs show how plants and animals are connected by their feeding relationships. • Plants are producers of their own food. • Animals are consumers and eat plants or other animals. • Microorganisms are decomposers and break down dead plant and animal material and return the nutrients to the soil. I found it really interesting to learn about how everything in an ecosystem is interdependent. Now I also know a bit more about healthy living! It is time now to join Walt to learn more about Matter and Materials! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 742018/05/02 3:58:27 PM 75Chapter 5: Ecosystems and food webs75 REVISION 1. Provide a definition for an ecosystem. 2. Why is the feeding relationships between plants and animals in an ecosystem called a food web? 3. What is the term given to animals that break down dead plant and animal material? 4. Read this blog entry made by a Grade 6 pupil in Limpopo province reporting on their environment. “ I live in the Waterberg area in northern Limpopo. This is the first area in South Africa to be named a biosphere reserve. During the stone age indigenous people lived in this area. They brought in cattle that overgrazed the grasslands and caused a terrible outbreak of tsetse flies. Then in the 1900s Dutch farmers brought in more cattle. All the cattle, goats and sheep of the farmers and the indigenous people almost destroyed the natural bushveld vegetation. Luckily the people realised the problems in time and started to re-introduce and protect original species of animals and plants in the area. White rhino, giraffe, hippopotamuses and different species of antelope and smaller buck returned. Eco-tourism is now very popular and farmers try really hard to stop soil erosion, and to introduce original grass species. Farmers also started to take away fences between their farms to allow animals to walk free.” a. Describe what happened to the land when all the cattle, sheep and goats were grazing on it. b. Explain what happened to the original, indigenous animals that lived on the land after the cattle farmers arrived. c. Can you predict what would have happened if the people did not change the way they used the land? d. What factors did they have to change to protect and conserve their land? e. If the farmers instead of removing the cattle and goats, rather planted crops on the land, what do you think would have eventually happened? f. What choices do you need to make, or what do you need to change or improve in your community, to stop similar types of environmental destruction from happening there?

All the materials around us are in one or more of these three states. For example, you have all three states in your body! There is bone in your skeleton. There is water in your blood. There is air in your lungs. We have also learnt that each of the states have unique properties: • Solids keep their shape. • Liquids flow and take the shape of their container. They fill up a container from the bottom up to a certain level. They take up a fixed amount of space in the container. • Gases also flow and take the shape of their container. They always fill up the whole space of the container and will escape if the container is open. We know when we have a solid or a liquid. It is easy to see a solid or a liquid. We cannot normally see gases. We can still check that gases are present by seeing their effects. Why do solids keep their shape but liquids and gases flow? Why does a liquid stay inside an open container (unless it is poured out), but a gas escapes? New words • states of matter • particles • atoms • molecules • microscope • vacuum NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 782018/05/02 3:58:28 PM 79Chapter 6: Solids, liquids and gases79 We have to look deep inside each state for the answers to these questions. We will have to use our imaginations like never before! 6.2 Arrangement of particles Did you know that all matter is actually made up of very small particles? These particles are called atoms and molecules, and we will learn more about them much later. For now, we are going to use the term particle to describe the smallest ‘building blocks’ that matter is made of. The particles that matter is made of are very, very small. Much, much smaller than a tiny grain of sand. Much, much smaller even than a speck of dust! Do you have any idea how small that is? Mmm, that is quite hard to imagine. I am not so sure. It is hard to imagine, isn’t it Walt? Most people find it very hard to think about, so do not worry, we will go through it slowly. The particles that matter is made of are much too small to see with the naked eye. They are even too small to see with a strong microscope. So how do we know they exist? Scientists, with special microscopes and other special scientific instruments, have collected evidence that they exist. It is now a well-known and accepted fact that all matter is made up of particles. Visit Particles of matter (video). goo.gl/qbccF NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 792018/05/02 3:58:28 PM Matter and materials and processing80 The particles in a solid Let’s imagine that we can shrink ourselves down to the size of such a particle of matter. What would we see if we could look around inside a solid? We would see the particles in the solid are packed tightly together. This explains why solids cannot be squeezed into a smaller shape – solids cannot be compressed. We would also see that the particles in the solid have fixed positions – they cannot move from their positions. This explains why solids keep their shape. Particles in a solid The particles in a liquid If we could shrink ourselves down to the size of a particle, and we could look around inside a liquid, what would we see? We would see that the particles in the liquid are also very close together. Like solids, liquids cannot be compressed either. Unlike solids, the particles of a liquid do not have fixed positions. They are always moving around. This explains why liquids flow, to take the shape of their container. Did you know? Even when it looks like the water inside a glass is still, the water particles are constantly moving! Particles in a liquid NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 802018/05/02 3:58:29 PM 81Chapter 6: Solids, liquids and gases81 The particles in a gas If we could shrink ourselves down to the size of a matter particle, and we could look around inside a gas, what would we see? We would see that the particles in the gas are far apart. The spaces between the particles are huge compared to the size of the particles themselves. These spaces are empty! We call this a vacuum. This explains why gases can be compressed – they can be squeezed into a smaller shape by pushing their particles closer together. We can make the spaces between them smaller. The particles of a gas are always moving freely. If they are in a closed container, they will spread out to fill the whole container. If they are in an open container they will not stay inside for long. They will flow out of the container, and disperse or diffuse (disperse means to spread out over an area or space).

In this activity we are going to pretend to be particles! We are going to behave in the same way that particles do in the three different states of matter. Your teacher will divide the class into groups and then we will go through the different states pretending to be the particles! INSTRUCTIONS: Solid: 1. Since you are the particles in a solid, you should sit or stand as closely as possible to (touching) each other, in neat rows, and move your body, but without moving your feet. 2. If we wanted to move these particles from their fixed positions, what should we give them? 3. If we wanted these particles to move into fixed positions again and not move around, what must we take away from them? Liquid: 1. Now let’s pretend to be the particles in a liquid.

If we wanted to move these particles further away from each other, what should we give them? 4. If we wanted these particles to move into fixed positions and not move around, what must we take away from them? Gas: 1. Now let’s pretend to be the particles in a gas. Stay in the same group. 2. Since you are the particles in gas, you should now move around and be as far from each other a possible. 3. If you should come into contact, you must move away from each other immediately.

If we wanted these particles to move more slowly and come closer to each other, what should we take away from them? 5. If we wanted these particles to move into fixed positions and not move around, what must we take away from them? 6.3 Behaviour of particles How do we decide whether a material is a solid, a liquid or a gas? The next activity will help us answer that question. We are going to think about some everyday materials. We will use our skills of observation to decide whether they are liquids, solids or gases. QUESTIONS Can you remember what your skills of observation are? Once we have decided whether a material is a solid, a liquid or a gas, we can make some predictions about the behaviour of the particles in each material. For this we will need our imagination, as particles are much too small to see with the naked eye. I can definitely use my imagination to think about this!

In the next activity we will learn about the particles in different states of the same material. QUESTIONS 1. In Activity 6.1 the learners in your class acted out the behaviour of particles in a solid, liquid and gas. When the ‘liquid’ learners changed to ‘solid’ learners, did the learners themselves change as they changed from solid to liquid? 2. Did they behave differently? In what ways did their behaviour change? 3. We know that materials can change from one state to another and back again. Can you think of an example of this? What happens to the particles inside a material when it changes from one state to another? The next activity will help us to answer that question. ACTIVITY 6.3: States of water INSTRUCTIONS: 1. In this activity we will watch a video about water in three different states: solid, liquid and gas. 2. Watch the video, then answer the questions that follow. 3. If you cannot watch the video, do not worry! Study the picture on the next page instead. QUESTIONS: 1. What do we call the solid state of water? 2. What do we call the liquid state of water? 3.

Do the particles in the ice change when the ice melts? 9. If ice and liquid water have the same particles, why do ice and liquid water have different properties? (Ice is solid and water is liquid.) 10. How can the water particles in ice be made to move freely? (Think of the ‘solid’ learners. What did we give them to make them move?)

A mixture is two or more different materials that have been mixed together. In some mixtures, the different materials are still clearly visible after mixing. A mixture of peanuts and raisins would be an example of such a mixture. How would we separate the peanuts and the raisins? Well, we could simply pick the raisins out of the peanuts! A mixture of peanuts and raisins Can you think of other mixtures in which the different materials are still clearly visible after mixing? Look at the pictures on page 90 for some ideas.

Such mixtures are called solutions. We will learn more about solutions shortly. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 902018/05/02 3:58:32 PM 91Chapter 7: Mixtures91 Making mixtures First, we will have some fun making mixtures. ACTIVITY 7.1: Mixing solids MATERIALS: • Bag of barley (beans or lentils will also do) • Bag of rice • Small packet of sugar • Clean sand (from the beach or from a building site) • Plastic spoons for scooping and mixing • Small yoghurt tubs or paper cups for mixing • Flour sieve INSTRUCTIONS (Part 1): 1. Place a scoop of barley in the mixing tub. 2. Place a scoop of rice in the mixing tub. 3. Stir the barley and rice until they are mixed. 4. Answer the questions below in your exercise book. QUESTIONS: 1. Can you still see the individual rice and barley grains? 2. Draw a picture of the mixture. 3. Separate the mixture into a pile of rice grains and a pile of barley grains. Write a sentence to explain how you separated the mixture. 4. Did the barley and rice grains change in any way, or do they still look the same as before they were mixed? INSTRUCTIONS (Part 2): 1. Place a scoop of rice in the mixing tub. 2. Place a scoop of sugar in the mixing tub. 3. Stir the sugar and rice until they are mixed. 4. Answer the questions below. QUESTIONS: 1.

Separate the mixture into a pile of rice grains and a pile of sugar grains. Write a sentence to explain how you separated the mixture. 4. Can you think of a quick way to separate the mixture, using a sieve? Describe what you would do to separate the mixture. Describe what would happen to the mixture. 5. Did the sugar and rice grains change in any way, or do they still look the same as before they were mixed? INSTRUCTIONS (Part 3): 1. Place a scoop of sand in the mixing tub. 2. Place a scoop of sugar in the mixing tub. 3. Stir the sugar and sand until they are mixed. 4. Answer the questions below. QUESTIONS: 1. Can you still see the individual sand and sugar grains? 2. Draw a picture of the mixture. 3. Can you separate the mixture into a pile of sand grains and a pile of sugar grains? How long would it take if you picked the sand grains out of the sugar one by one? 4. Do you think that it would be possible to separate the mixture using a sieve? Why do you think so? In the previous activity we mixed solid materials with different sized grains and learnt that: • when the grains are large enough, we can separate them by hand; and • when the two materials have grains of different sizes they can be separated by sieving. In the next activity we will explore mixtures of solids and liquids. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 922018/05/02 3:58:33 PM 93Chapter 7: Mixtures93 ACTIVITY 7.2: Mixing a solid and a liquid MATERIALS: • Clean sand (from the beach or from a building site) • Plastic spoons for scooping and mixing • Yoghurt tub for mixing in • Flour sieve • Kitchen towel or paper towel INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Place five scoops of sand in the mixing tub. 2. Pour water into the mixing tub until it is half-full. 3. Stir the sand and water until they are mixed. 4.

Can you separate the mixture into a pile of sand grains and water? How long would it take if you picked the sand grains out of the water one by one? 4. Would it be possible to separate the sand from the water using the sieve? Say why or why not. 5. Would it be possible to separate the sand from the water using the paper towel? If you think it would be possible, explain what you would do. 6. Do you think it would be possible to separate sugar and water in the same way (by filtering the mixture through a towel)? Say why or why not. In the previous activity we mixed a solid material (sand) with a liquid (water) and learnt that sometimes a mixture of liquid and solid can be separated by filtering. In the activity the towel was used as a filter. Is it possible to mix liquids? Can you think of examples of mixtures of liquids?

If you think it would be possible, explain what you would do. 6. Do you think it would be possible to separate a mixture of juice and water using any of the methods that we have used so far (hand-separating, sieving, filtering or decanting)? Say why or why not. In the previous activity we mixed two liquids (water and oil) and learned that sometimes a mixture of two liquids can be separated by decanting. Separating mixtures In the next section we will summarise all the different ways of separating mixtures. We have made different mixtures and tried to separate them using a variety of methods. In this section we will revise all these separation methods. ACTIVITY 7.4: Separating mixtures INSTRUCTIONS (Part 1): The following table has photos of mixtures. 1.

In a mixture, the materials that have been mixed do not change. They keep their individual properties. Sometimes it is possible to separate a mixture into the individual materials again. KEY CONCEPTS • A mixture consists of two or more different materials mixed together. • Sometimes mixtures can be separated into the individual materials again. • Some of the ways in which mixtures can be separated are: sieving, filtering, hand sorting, and settling followed by decanting. • When a material changes from a solid to a liquid, the process is called melting. • When a material forms a solution in another material, the process is called dissolving. • Melting and dissolving are two different processes.

NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 992018/05/02 3:58:35 PM 100 8 Solutions as special mixtures KEY QUESTIONS • When is a mixture also a solution? • Do all substances dissolve in water? • Is there a limit to how much of a substance can be dissolved in a given amount of water? • How can the components of a solution be separated? 8.1 Solutions In the last chapter we looked at mixtures. We are now going to look at a special type of mixture, which are called solutions. When is a mixture also a solution? When two substances are mixed it will be possible to still see each substance in the mixture. Is sugar and sand a mixture? Yes! A solution is a special type of mixture. What makes a solution so special? When is a mixture also a solution? Often, the best way to answer a question is to ask it in a different way: When is a mixture not a solution? In the next activity we are going to make a few mixtures and then decide which of them are solutions, and which of them are not. That should help us find the answer to the question: When is a mixture also a solution? New words • solution • copper sulfate • solvent • solute • evidence NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1002018/05/02 3:58:35 PM 101Chapter 8: Solutions as special mixtures101 ACTIVITY 8.1: When is a mixture also a solution? In this activity we are going to mix substances with water to see which ones make solutions. How do you think will we know when a substance has made a solution with the water? MATERIALS: • Small quantities of the following substances: –sugar –salt –sand –oil –vinegar –flour –copper sulfate • Tap water • Clean yoghurt tubs (small) • Plastic spoons for scooping and stirring INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Half-fill a yoghurt cup with tap water. 2. Place one small scoop of sugar in the water and stir it well. 3. Look at the mixture and discuss what it looks like. 4. At the top of the table on page 102 there are a few possible observations. Choose the one that is the best description for what you observed, by making a ✗ in the column. (You may also choose more than one column.) The first substance (sugar) has been filled in to show you what you should do. 5. Copy the table in your exercise books and record your observations like this. 6. Once you have recorded your observations, you can empty the yoghurt tub. 7. Repeat the steps until you have tested all the substances on the list.

Which of the substances seemed to disappear when they were mixed with the water? 2. Which of the substances in this activity did not form solutions with water? (Hint: Which ones did not look as if they disappeared into the water?) What is a solution? When two substances make a solution, it will look as if the one substance has disappeared into the other. • The substance that looks as if it has disappeared is called the solute. • The substance that we can still see is called the solvent. • The solvent and solute together are called the solution. QUESTIONS Is sugar and sand a solution? You may want to page back to Part 3 of Activity 7.1 on mixing solids (page 92) to remind yourself. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1022018/05/02 3:58:35 PM 103Chapter 8: Solutions as special mixtures103 ACTIVITY 8.2: Which mixtures are solutions? In this activity we will use our observations from Activity 8.1 (When is a mixture also a solution?) to decide which of the mixtures we made were solutions. QUESTIONS: 1. In Activity 8.1 we mixed different substances with water. We saw that some of the substances looked as if they had disappeared in the water. a. What name do we give to the substance that looks as if it has disappeared? b. What name do we give to the substance that we can still see? c. What name do we give to this type of mixture? 2.

From the mixtures above, choose an example of a solution that consists of a liquid solute and a liquid solvent. d. From the mixtures above, choose an example of a mixture of two liquids that is not a solution. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1032018/05/02 3:58:35 PM Matter and materials and processing104 Wait! How is it possible for one substance to disappear into another? Good question, Walt. We know that Science is not magic, and that it is not possible for something to disappear! How do we explain the observation that one substance (the solute) disappears into the other (the solvent)? In the next activity we will look more closely at a solution, in order to understand how it is possible for the solute to look as if it disappears into the solvent. ACTIVITY 8.3: What is a solution? MATERIALS: • Copper sulfate crystals • Tap water • Clear container (glass beaker, test tube or water glass) • Plastic spoon for scooping and stirring INSTRUCTIONS: 1.

Mix one small scoop of the copper sulfate with enough water to dissolve it completely (half a cup of water should be enough). Let it stand for a few minutes until it clears. 3. Look at the copper sulfate solution and write a sentence to describe it in the table you have copied. Save it for answering the questions that follow. QUESTIONS: 1. Look at the solution. How can you tell that there is copper sulfate in the water? Another way to ask this question would be: What evidence do you have that there is copper sulfate in the water? 2. Can you see any copper sulfate crystals moving about in the water? 3. Why can’t we see copper sulfate crystals moving about in the water? 4. What do you think happened to the copper sulfate particles? Where are they now? 5. Draw a picture of the particles in the copper sulfate solution in your exercise books.

Substances that do not form solutions when they are mixed with water are called substances. 2. Substances that form solutions when they are mixed with water are called substances. In the previous chapter, we saw how to separate mixtures. For example, we could hand sort the objects, sieve the larger grains out of the mixture, and decant the oil from the top of the water. But what about a solution? Do you think you can separate the sugar from the solution once it has been dissolved? Let’s try to find out the answer to this question! INVESTIGATION 8.1: How can we recover a solute (sugar) from the solution? AIM: What do you want to find out? MATERIALS AND APPARATUS: • Sugar solution • Two beakers • Funnel • Filter paper • Evaporating dish • Stand • Bunsen burner • Matches METHOD: 1. Pour a small amount of the sugar solution into an evaporating dish. 2. Place the dish outside, or on a windowsill, in a sunny spot. 3. Leave the dish outside and check regularly to observe what is happening to the sugar solution. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1072018/05/02 3:58:36 PM Matter and materials and processing108 4. Your teacher will demonstrate whether you can also recover the sugar by boiling the solution. 5. Copy the table below in your exercise books and record all your observations. RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS: MethodResult – Could you recover the sugar from the solution? Sieving or filtering Settling overnight Evaporation Boiling 1. Which methods worked to recover the sugar from the solution? 2. What was left at the bottom after completing these methods? 3. Why do you think this happens? 4. Which method do you think works best and why? CONCLUSION: What can you conclude from this investigation? Now that we have looked at how to separate a solute from a solution, have you ever wondered just how much sugar you could dissolve in water? Do you drink tea for example, and put sugar in? How many teaspoons of sugar do you think you can dissolve in a cup of tea? In the next section we will explore this idea. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1082018/05/02 3:58:36 PM 109Chapter 8: Solutions as special mixtures109 8.3 Saturated solutions Suppose we were to make a cup of tea and we put in three teaspoons of sugar. Mmmm... lovely sweet, warm tea! QUESTIONS Now imagine you add three more teaspoons of sugar to the tea. How many teaspoons of sugar did we add? When the particles of a solute spread throughout the particles of a solvent, we say the solute dissolves in the solvent to make a solution. Do you think six spoons of sugar will dissolve in the tea? Who has tried this at home? What did you find? Now let us imagine three more teaspoons of sugar is added to the tea. Very sweet tea! Do you think all the sugar will dissolve? How much sugar do you think we will be able to dissolve in the tea? An infinite amount? A cupful or less? Let’s try find out. ACTIVITY 8.5: How much solute will dissolve? MATERIALS: • Clear container (a glass beaker or water glass would be best) • Tap water • Small packet of sugar • Plastic spoon for scooping and stirring INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Measure half a cup of water into the container. 2. Add a teaspoon of sugar to the water. Stir until all the sugar has dissolved. New words • saturated solution • unsaturated solution • insoluble substance NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1092018/05/02 3:58:36 PM Matter and materials and processing110 3. Add another teaspoon and stir again. 4. Keep adding teaspoons of sugar until no more sugar can dissolve. QUESTIONS: 1. How many spoons did you add until no more sugar dissolved? 2. How did you know that no more sugar could dissolve? 3. Complete the following sentences by writing saturated or unsaturated in the open spaces. a. When no more solute can dissolve in a solution, we say it is a solution. b. When more solute can be dissolved in a solution, we say the solution is . Now let’s have some fun with saturated solutions! ACTIVITY 8.6: Making sugar crystals MATERIALS: • Half a cup water • One cup table sugar • Clean glass jar • Food colouring • Pencil • Rough string (cooking twine) • Beaker or pan for boiling water and making solution • Spoon • Stove or bunsen burner and stand INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Tie a length of string onto a pencil. The string should be long enough to reach almost to the bottom of your glass jar. 2. Make a saturated sugar solution by boiling the water in the pan, slowly adding sugar a teaspoon at a time. If you have a bunsen burner and stand, you can do this in a beaker over the flame.

Stir after each spoonful and keep adding sugar until the sugar won’t dissolve any more in the water. If you do not add enough sugar, your crystals will not grow quickly. If you use too much sugar, your crystals will grow on the undissolved crystals and not on the string. 4. Pour some food colouring into your saturated solution to give the crystals a colour. 5. Pour your solution into the clear glass jar. If you have undissolved sugar at the bottom of your container, avoid getting it in the jar. 6. Place your string inside the glass jar. 7. Place your jar where it will not be disturbed and check on your string each day and observe the crystal growth. 8. Allow the crystals to grow until they have reached a size that you desire, or until they have stopped growing. You can pull the string out and allow the crystals to dry. You can eat them or keep them! QUESTIONS: 1. How long did it take for crystals to start forming on the string? 2. What are the crystals made of? 3. Why do you think we boiled the water when dissolving the sugar in the solution? An example of crystals in nature Have you ever visited a cave? Inside, you may have seen crystal formations called stalactites and stalagmites. Stalactites and stalagmites form inside limestone caves. Stalactites hang down like icicles and stalagmites grow from the floor of the cave upwards. Stalactites and stalagmites always occur in pairs. Caves form when water slowly dissolves the limestone underground. The dissolved limestone can crystallise again when the water evaporates. This is also a slow process and it happens when water drips down from the ceiling of the cave over a long period of time. The water drops that land on the floor of the cave also evaporate over time and when they land on the same spot, a stalagmite will grow on that spot.

Cango Caves in Oudtshoorn in South Africa 1 Insoluble substances We have a word for substances that do not form solutions when they are mixed with water. These substances are called insoluble substances. QUESTIONS Can you remember what substances are called that do form solutions when they are mixed with water? Write the term in your exercise book. Some substances that are insoluble in water may be soluble in other solvents. Think about this for a moment: Is nail polish soluble in water? No, of course not, or it would be possible to wash it off! What would be a good solvent for nail polish? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1122018/05/02 3:58:36 PM 113Chapter 8: Solutions as special mixtures113 What have we learnt about solutions as special mixtures? Soluble substances dissolve in water and insoluble substances do not dissolve in water. Water is not the only solvent. Some substances which are not soluble in water, are soluble in other solvents. When no more solute can dissolve in a solution, we say it is a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one where it is possible to dissolve more solute in the solvent. Solutions are special kinds of mixtures. When we want to decide whether a mixture is also a solution, we can use the following questions to decide: Question about the mixture The mixture is a solution The mixture is not a solution Can you see the solute in the solvent? NoYe s Does the solute settle out? NoYe s Can the mixture be separated using filtration? NoYe s Can the mixture be separated by evaporation? Ye sNo NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1132018/05/02 3:58:37 PM Matter and materials and processing114 KEY CONCEPTS • A solution is a special kind of mixture. Like all mixtures it consists of two (or more) substances mixed together. • A solution is made up of a solvent (such as water) in which one or more solutes have been dissolved. • In a solution, the solute looks as if it disappears into the solvent. This is because the particles of the solute and the solvent become closely mixed. • There are many kinds of solutions, but the most well-known ones are mixtures of a solid and a liquid, such as sugar and water. • Not all substances dissolve in water. Those that dissolve are called soluble substances; those that do not dissolve are called insoluble substances. • Solutions cannot be separated by sieving, filtering, hand sorting, or settling and decanting. This is because solute particles are dispersed between the solvent particles. • Solutions can be separated by heating so that the solvent evaporates. The dry solute will be left behind. • When we have dissolved so much solute in the solvent that no more solute can possibly dissolve, we say that the solution is saturated.

In this chapter we are going to make more solutions. We will perform some experiments to see if we can make our solutes dissolve faster. Before we do that, we have to answer an important question: Is melting and dissolving the same? What do you think? ACTIVITY 9.1: Is melting and dissolving the same? In this activity we are going to explore the differences between melting and dissolving. We have learnt that matter can exist as three different states: solid, liquid and gas. INSTRUCTIONS (Part 1): 1. Watch the short video clip to remind yourself how a solid, liquid and gas are different from each other. 2. Look out for the part where the states change. The solid changes to a liquid and then the liquid changes into a gas. Remember that a state change is when a substance changes from one state (like a solid) to another state (like a liquid). Visit States of matter goo.gl/gf7Ck NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1172018/05/02 3:58:38 PM Matter and materials and processing118 3. The following diagram shows how the different states of matter are related to each other. It also shows what the different state changes or processes are called: Evaporation Condensation Melting Freezing Solid LiquidGas States of matter and processes QUESTIONS: 1. What is needed to change a solid into a liquid? 2. What is the process called when a solid changes into a liquid? 3. Fill in the missing words: The particles in a have fixed positions. When the solid melts, the particles are free to move from their positions. The state in which particles are close to each other but free to move around is called the state. INSTRUCTIONS (Part 2): 1. Do you remember dissolving sugar in water in the previous chapter? (Investigation 8.1 on page 107) 2. The picture on page 118 shows what we would see if we could shrink ourselves down to the size of water and sugar particles (molecules).

Sugar molecule Water molecule Solution of water and sugar molecules (particles) QUESTIONS: 1. Why is the sugar no longer visible? Give a reason. 2. How can we be sure the sugar has not disappeared and that it is still there? 3. How is the picture of the sugar and water mixture different from the liquid shown in the diagram on page 118? 4. What do we call it when two or more substances are combined? 5. Can we say that the sugar melts? Give a reason.

The word ‘rate’ has many meanings. In Science, when we use the word ‘rate’ we usually mean how fast or how slow. Walt likes his coffee sweet, with three teaspoons of sugar. For the coffee to taste sweet, the sugar must be dissolved. Here is a photo of a cup of coffee. Answer the questions that follow. Cup of coffee 1 QUESTIONS 1. Is the cup of coffee a mixture? Give a reason. 2. Is the cup of coffee a solution? Give a reason. 3. Make a list of the components in the coffee mixture. 4. Which component is the solvent? 5. Is the sugar a solute or a solvent? 6. What could Walt do to make sure that the sugar dissolves quickly? Stirring a solution is just one of the things we can do to make a solute dissolve faster.

Stirring affects the rate of dissolving. EXTENSION QUESTION: Why do you think stirring makes the salt dissolve faster? KEY CONCEPTS • The time it takes for a substance to dissolve is called the rate of dissolving or the rate of dissolution. • The rate at which a substance dissolves can be affected by three factors: –Temperature of the solution –Whether or not the solution is stirred (or shaken) –Grain size of the solute • A solute will generally dissolve faster if the solvent in which it dissolves is warm. • A solute will dissolve faster when the solution is stirred or shaken. • A solute will dissolve faster if the size of its grains is small.

NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1292018/05/02 3:58:41 PM 130 10 Mixtures and water resources KEY QUESTIONS • Why is it important for humans, plants and animals to have access to clean water? • What is the difference between clean water and polluted water? • What are the different things that pollute water? • Why should wetlands be protected? We have learnt that water can dissolve many substances – water is a good solvent. When water has unhealthy substances in it, we say the water is polluted. Polluted water is not clean. 10.1 Water pollution When is water clean? We could say that clean water is water that is free of pollutants. What are pollutants? Pollutants are substances (or objects) that do not naturally belong in the water and are harmful to us and to the environment. Pollutants may be any of the following: • Insoluble pollutants are things that do not dissolve in the water but make it dirty, such as oil, garbage and toilet waste (sewage). • Soluble pollutants are chemicals, such as soaps and fertilisers, and poisons like insecticides and acids. • Living germs (bacteria) can cause people or animals to get sick. In the next activity we will discuss pollution and where it comes from.

Look at the photos on page 131 and make a list of all the objects that do not belong in the water. 2. What are the three main categories of pollutants found in water? 3. Which category of pollutants would you be able to see with the naked eye? 4. Which categories of pollutants would you not be able to see with the naked eye? 5. How do you think insoluble pollutants end up in water? 6. How do you think soluble pollutants end up in water? 7. How do you think bacteria that cause illnesses like diarrhoea and cholera end up in water? 8. How do you think oil ends up in the water, especially in oceans? 9. What do all three categories of pollutants have in common? Have you noticed that humans and their activities are often the reason why water becomes polluted? As humans, we often forget that we are sharing this natural resource with many other organisms. Many of our activities can change the quality of the water in a way that affects the health and behaviour of other organisms. So, as humans, we have a very important responsibility to look after our water resources.

In nature water is purified in natural environments called wetlands. Wetlands are very efficient natural ‘water treatment’ facilities, and in this section we will learn how they work. What are wetlands? An area is a wetland if it has the following: • Waterlogged soil • Water-loving plants • High water table If soil is waterlogged, it means that it is full of water. The water table refers to the level in the ground where all the soil below this level is waterlogged (full of water). If an area has a high water table, then this level is close to the surface. This means water will not filter down into the ground but remain on the surface forming a wetland. Examples of wetlands: • Marshes • Floodplains • Swamps • Lakes and pans • Seeps and springs • Estuaries • River banks Look at the photos of different wetlands: New words • water table • waterlogged • marshes • waterways • drainage Visit Wetlands in South Africa. goo.gl/PQvKw Visit Isimangaliso Wetland Park (website). goo.gl/2RT6H NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1332018/05/02 3:58:43 PM Matter and materials and processing134 Wetlands are not necessarily wet throughout the year: • A temporary wetland is wet between one and four months of the year. • A seasonal wetland is wet during the rainy season. This means it will be wet between five and eleven months of the year, depending on the length of the rainy season. • A permanent wetland is wet throughout the year. Why are wetlands so important? Wetlands are very special places that should be protected. But why are they so important? Three unique abilities of wetlands make them very important. 1. Wetlands are like giant sponges: Wetlands soak up water and store it. During a drought, when there is not much rain, this stored water can help to keep rivers and streams flowing so that animals and plants can stay alive. Did you know? In South Africa, the most well- known wetlands are the St Lucia wetlands in KwaZulu-Natal. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1342018/05/02 3:58:44 PM 135Chapter 10: Mixtures and water resources135 2. Wetlands slow down flood waters: Water that is ‘in flood’ flows so strongly and quickly that it becomes dangerous. It can drown people and animals, and it can cause damage to property and also to the environment, through soil erosion. Floodwater slows down when it flows into a wetland, because the wetland is a large area that can hold a large amount of water. 3. Wetlands are natural filtration systems for purifying water: As water flows through the wetland, it is filtered. Plants in the wetland trap soil particles and sediments, nutrients, as well as pollutants and disease-causing organisms, which make the water unsafe. ACTIVITY 10.2: Making a model of a wetland MATERIALS: • Grass moss or other garden moss • Bricks • Sand and soil • Shallow plastic trays (about 7–10 cm deep) • Hardboard • Watering can • Measuring tool to measure two litres of water • Watch or stopwatch • Plastic window box • Hand or electric drill IMPORTANT! To be used only under strict adult supervision. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Drill a hole in the middle and at the bottom of one side of the plastic box. 2. Pack two layers of bricks, the window box, and the hardboard as shown in the illustration on page 136. 3. Position the hole you drilled in the tray over the centre of the hardboard so you do not accidentally lose water over the sides that should run into the window box. 4. Fill your watering can with two litres of water.

Wetlands are also important as they provide a habitat to many different plant and animal species. Wetlands are important because of their biodiversity. QUESTIONS 1. Do you remember studying habitats in Grade 4 and Grade 5? What does a habitat provide to an organism? 2. Discuss with your partner what you understand by the term ‘biodiversity’ and write it down in your exercise books. Let’s now do some research about the wetlands in South Africa and their importance. ACTIVITY 10.3: Research the different wetlands in South Africa MATERIALS: • Pamphlets, posters and any other reading material on wetlands • Books or other reading material from home, or printed pages from the internet • Poster material: cardboard, glue, colour pencils, scissors, pictures, etc. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. You might get to visit a wetland near your school or hear a talk by a conservationist. 2. If you do not get this opportunity, you must still complete the project by doing research in books, pamphlets and on the internet. Answer the questions that follow. 3.

What does a wetland do for the environment? 3. What does a wetland do for plants and animals? 4. What does a wetland provide for humans? 5. What are the environmental dangers that wetlands face? 6. Choose a specific wetland and assess the habitats, biodiversity and water quality of this wetland. 7. What would the impact be to biodiversity and water quality if this wetland was lost? Wetlands should be protected for several reasons: • They are natural water-purification systems. • They act like sponges to store water in the wet season and supply water in the dry season. • They slow down flood water to prevent damage to property and the environment. KEY CONCEPTS • Clean water is vitally important to ensure the health of humans, animals and plants. • Water can be polluted by insoluble substances, soluble substances and disease-causing organisms. • Wetlands act as natural water purifiers because they can absorb soluble and insoluble impurities from water, and they regulate water flow across the landscape.

Can you remember what pollutants are? Write it down in your exercise books. We have also learned that nature has special methods of cleaning polluted water. Water purification happens in special natural environments called wetlands. Wetlands are very efficient natural water treatment facilities, but they work slowly. Humans, animals and plants need fresh water every day, and for this reason we have to clean our dirty water so that it can be reused. Cleaning dirty water is what this chapter is all about. Why do we need clean water? Why is it so important for humans, plants and animals to have clean water? • Our bodies contain a lot of water. In fact you are mostly water! We need water every day because we lose water constantly with the waste our bodies produce and excrete. The water we drink must be clean to prevent us from becoming sick or being poisoned. • Plants and animals need clean water too, so that they can grow and be healthy. We need healthy plants and animals in our environment because they provide an ecological balance and food. • Water is also used for fun. Water sports are a very popular recreational activity and include things like swimming, surfing and water-skiing. We want clean water in our seas and lakes so we can enjoy being in the water without becoming ill. How can water be purified? Imagine you are in a place without clean water. The only water around is a muddy stream. How can the dirty water be made clean enough to drink? When thinking about how to purify water, we need to consider what it is that we need to do to separate the contaminating particles from the water. Did you know? Water is needed for humans to avoid dehydration. The amount you need each day depends on the temperature, how much activity you are involved in, and other factors. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1422018/05/02 3:58:46 PM 143Chapter 11: Processes to purify water143 The muddy water is actually a mixture of sand and water, and possibly other contaminants. QUESTIONS 1. Do you remember in the beginning of the term we looked at different ways to separate out mixtures? What are some of these ways? 2. Which methods do you think would be useful to separate the large impurities from the dirty water? 3. Which methods would be useful to remove the soluble impurities from the dirty water? Let’s investigate some different ways to purify water at home or at school. ACTIVITY 11.1: Purifying water by distillation MATERIALS: • Clean, dry small pot or container • Muddy water • Big, deep cooking pot • Ruler • One marble or clean stone • Plastic cling wrap INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Pour the muddy water into the big pot until it is about 5 cm deep. (You can use the ruler to measure the depth of the water.) 2. Place the smaller pot or container inside the bigger pot. 3. Cover the bigger pot with cling wrap. 4. Place a marble or stone in the middle of the cling wrap so that it is above the small pot inside the big pot. You have now made a still for purifying water. 5. Leave the still out in the sun for a day. 6. Look carefully at the still and answer the questions that follow. 7. If you have a phone with a camera, you could take pictures of the still and show them to your class.

Where was the dirt at the end of the experiment? 6. Make a poster of the process. You can draw pictures or use the photos you took of the experiment. QUESTIONS Can you remember what methods we used to remove sand from water in Activity 7.2 (page 93) in Chapter 7 about mixtures? Filtering is a good way of removing insoluble substances from water. Large pieces of insoluble substances can also be sieved out of the water. The Quantum Club are planning a camping trip and they have invited you and your classmates to come with them. They have all the equipment such as tents, sleeping bags and mats. The only problem is that there is no clean drinking water at the campsite. For such a large group, they cannot take enough bottles of clean water. So, Walt has decided that the group should build a filter to purify the muddy water from the nearby stream. But they do not know how! We need to help them design and build a filter to purify the water on the camping trip. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1442018/05/02 3:58:46 PM 145Chapter 11: Processes to purify water145 ACTIVITY 11.2: Design, make and evaluate a filter DESIGN BRIEF: Write a short statement where you state what you are going to be designing and why. Your filter has the following specifications: • The filter must be able to filter a cup of muddy water and the water which comes out must be cleaner than the water that went in. • The filter must be able to hang up, for example from the branch of a tree. • You must be able to use it outside. Your filter has the following constraints: • You cannot make the filter at home, you must make it in class. • You are confined to using as many recyclable materials as possible, such as two-litre plastic bottles, plastic bags, etc. INVESTIGATE: We now need to do some more investigating about how to purify water. We saw how to purify water using a still and evaporation. But what are the ways to purify water using a filter? Do some research on the internet and in books to answer the following questions: 1. What types of filters can you make? 2. What materials do these filters make use of? 3. What is the purpose of each of the materials used to filter? For example, are some materials there for filtering large particles and some for filtering small particles? If so, which one is which? Did you know? Water purification tablets can be used in emergencies, such as a flood or earthquake, when you do not have access to clean water. The tablets remove microscopic impurities and chemicals that could harm you. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1452018/05/02 3:58:47 PM Matter and materials and processing146 DESIGN: Let’s now get on to designing your filter! Answer these questions before you start drawing your design. 1. What kind of filter are you going to design? 2. What size and shape will your filter be? 3. What recyclable materials could you use? 4. How are you going to hang it up, for example from the branch of a tree? 5. How will you collect the water that has been filtered? In your exercise books, draw a design for your filter. Remember to label the different parts and show which materials you are going to use. Leave some space to do a second drawing as you might come up with a better design while you are making your filter and see ways to improve it. MAKE: Now that you have a design, it is time to make your filter according to the specifications and constraints. Once you have all made your filters, you need to test them out to see if they work. Do the testing outside. Show the class how your filter works and pour a cup of muddy water through the filter, and collect the water that comes out. IMPORTANT! Do not drink the water! You do not know if you have completely purified the water. To further purify the water from the filters, you can also do a solar distillation using the still you made in the last activity to remove solids. Finally, you must boil the water! EVALUATE: After you have made your filter, you have to ask: Does it work and could you do a better one? 1. Compare the water before and after filtering. Was the water cleaner after filtering? 2. Which impurities did your filter remove – big or small or both? 3. How much filtered water were you able to collect from your filter? Was it the same amount that you poured in? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1462018/05/02 3:58:47 PM 147Chapter 11: Processes to purify water147 4. Did your filter leak anywhere? If so, how could you prevent it from leaking? 5. Do you think you could further purify the water you filtered by passing it through your filter again? Try it out and see if this makes a difference. 6. How could you improve your design? 7. What further steps could you take to purify the water that comes out of your filter? COMMUNICATE: 1. The last part in the design process is to communicate what you designed and made to others, so that they can also learn about what you did and learn from you. 2. Write a paragraph in your exercise books where you tell Walt about the filter that you designed and made to take on the camping trip to purify the muddy water in the stream. 3. Tell Walt what you found that worked and what did not work, and anything that you would change. 11.2 How is water purified by municipalities? Do you have running water in your home? If you have, you are very fortunate, because many South Africans do not. Clean water coming out of the tap. 1 Visit Purifying water while hiking (video). goo.gl/LEB5J NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1472018/05/02 3:58:47 PM Matter and materials and processing148 South African municipal water is generally clean and fresh, and safe to drink. How does it get that way? This section tells the story of how water is treated at the large municipal facilities. The water from a tap does not start out clean and fresh. It may come from a river or a dam, or it may even be waste water that was used by a community or in a factory. The process of purifying the water is called water treatment, and the place where it happens is called a water treatment plant. So what exactly happens at a typical water treatment plant? There are five steps (or processes) in the treatment of water. The five processes commonly used to treat water are screening, settling, sedimentation, aeration and disinfection. Let us take a closer look at each process. Step 1: Screening The raw water that arrives at the plant may contain dirt, fish, rubbish, plants and even sewage. These things are screened out as the water flows into the plant. This means that the water passes through a screen (which is very much like a large sieve), and the solid matter stays behind on the screen. After the screening step the water is still dirty, but the large pieces of rubbish have been removed. Step 2: Settling During this step the raw water is allowed to stand in a large tank called a settling tank. Visit Fun activity to get you thinking about water, and where it goes once we have used it. goo.gl/eh8ke New words • water treatment plant • settling tank • sludge • aeration • disinfection NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1482018/05/02 3:58:47 PM 149Chapter 11: Processes to purify water149 QUESTIONS What happens to the dirt when muddy water stands for a long time? When the raw water stands in the settling tank, the medium-sized pieces of solid matter (called sludge) sink to the bottom of the tank. The raw water at the top is still dirty but now it only contains small pieces of solid matter. The bits of solid matter left are small enough for small organisms (such as bacteria) to eat. This is what happens in the next step of the treatment process. Step 3: Aeration The raw water now flows into a special tank that contains bacteria. These are useful bacteria, because they help to break down the last little bits of solid matter, as well as break down any natural soluble pollutants. Since bacteria need oxygen to stay alive and healthy, air is bubbled through the water. This process is called aeration, because the name comes from the word ‘air’. Step 4: Filtering Next, the water flows through a special filter made of layers of sand and gravel. It is just like the one you designed, only much bigger. The gravel layer of the filter is about 30 cm deep and the sand layer is about a metre deep! The filtering step removes any remaining particles and most of the bacteria left in the water. After this step the water is clear, but some germs and bacteria from Step 3 may still be in the water. Remember that germs and bacteria are small enough to pass between the gaps between sand and gravel.

KEY CONCEPTS • Clean water is important for people, plants and animals. • Water can be purified by processes such as sieving, filtering, settling, decanting, boiling and adding chemicals to kill germs. • The water we use in our homes is purified before and after we use it.

What would you say electricity is? Connecting simple circuits We are using electricity all the time. We need to understand what it is, and how to use it safely and correctly. Have you ever used a flashlight (torch)? What is it used for? How do you get the flashlight to work? Let us try to get the bulb of a torch to work. We want to do this without using the torch itself. ACTIVITY 12.2: How to get a light bulb to work MATERIALS: • D-size battery (1.5 V) • Torchlight bulb • Three pieces of electric wire (15–20 cm long with the ends about 1 cm stripped of the plastic insulating material) • Adhesive tape or Prestik • Piece of cardboard • Two thumbnails with metal (brass) tops (remove plastic if tops are covered) • Metal paperclip (remove the plastic if covered) INSTRUCTIONS: 1.

NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1582018/05/02 3:58:49 PM 159Chapter 12: Electric circuits159 Now that we have investigated different ways of making a simple circuit, let’s explain it in more detail. QUESTIONS Electric circuits have different components. What does ‘component’ mean? Look up the definition for component in your dictionary and write it in your exercise books. You should have found that components are basic devices used to manage the flow of electricity. Basic components for a circuit, includes components such as cells, light bulbs, conducting wires, buzzers, and switches. A simple electric circuit has at least three components: • A source of electrical energy, such as battery cells. • Conducting material, such as the electric wires. • A device that transfers the energy for a useful purpose, such as the bulb that provides light. Simple circuit Do you think there is something flowing through the bulb when it lights up? When we connect the bulb so that it lights up there is something flowing through the whole circuit. When it does not light up, we have not made a proper or complete pathway for electricity. This flowing thing is called electric current. If the bulb lights up, we say there is an electric current in the circuit. The electric circuit is a system for transferring energy. Think again about the circuits that you have constructed so far. Did you know? ‘Cell’ is the scientific term for what most people call a battery in everyday life. What a car has is a real battery. It has six cells that are connected end to end inside the battery case. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1592018/05/02 3:58:49 PM Energy and change and systems and control160 QUESTIONS What are the conditions for the bulb to light up? Let us look at the torch once more: 1. Is the bulb providing light all the time? 2. When does it provide light and when not? 3. What do we call the component of the flashlight that allows us to turn the light on and off? A switch is used to turn an electrical device on or off. But how does it work? A typical torch – the big red button is the switch. ACTIVITY 12.3: Investigating how a switch works MATERIALS: • Paperclip • Two thumbnails (drawing pins) • Piece of cardboard • Light bulb • Three pieces of wire • Cells INSTRUCTIONS: 1. To make the switch, bend the paper clip as shown in the following diagram. Visit Simulations to build simple circuits: goo.gl/Vimj2 goo.gl/jrGJ3 NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1602018/05/02 3:58:49 PM 161Chapter 12: Electric circuits161 2. Pin the ends of the two wires down on the cardboard with the thumb nails. One of the thumbnails should also pin down the paper clip. 3.

We now want to use the switch. Use the same setup for a simple electric circuit with a bulb, cell and two wires as you did in Activity 12.2. 6. Connect the paperclip switch to the battery by using a third electric wire. Remember to keep the wire ends in position with cellotape or Prestik. The setup of a switch and simple circuit. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1612018/05/02 3:58:50 PM Energy and change and systems and control162 QUESTIONS: 1. Move the paper clip onto the second thumbnail. What happens? 2. Move the paper clip away from the second thumbnail? What happens now? 3. Explain why you think the paper clip and cardboard device can be called a switch. We already said that a switch is used to turn an electrical device on or off. We can also say that a switch is used to close or open an electric circuit. When the switch is on, the circuit is closed or completed. An electric current then exists in the circuit. We could also say there is an unbroken electric pathway in the circuit. When the switch is off the circuit is open. In this case there is no electric current in the circuit. The electric pathway is now broken or incomplete. QUESTIONS Name four other electrical appliances in your home that have a switch. Circuit components We need to have a closer look at the components in the electric circuit. This will help us to understand how a circuit works.

Look at a typical flashlight cell. 2. Describe in words what the cell looks like. Refer specifically to the ends of the cell. 3. Look carefully to see if you can identify a positive (+) and a negative (–) sign on the cell. Which side of the cell is marked with a positive sign and which side with a negative sign? 4. Below is a photo of a cell. Indicate on a sketch which is the positive and which the negative pole of the cell. Use a (+) and (–) sign as you have seen it on the cell.

Look at the photo below of different batteries. A cell is a single unit of a power supply which uses chemical energy to produce electricity. A battery is a group of cells joined in series (one after the other). Different sized and shaped batteries 6. You may be lucky enough to have different types of batteries in your class, such as from a watch, a cellphone or a car. If not, ask an adult in your family to show you a car battery, a cellphone battery and a battery used in a watch after school. 7. Copy the table below and draw sketches of such batteries. Indicate on each sketch the positive and the negative pole of each kind of battery. Below are some photos to help you if you cannot find these batteries. Car batteryCellphone battery Watch battery NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1642018/05/02 3:58:50 PM 165Chapter 12: Electric circuits165 Car batteryThese watch batteries are quite small! For some appliances it is very important that the batteries are put correctly into a specific position. Why do you think this is the case? This is because the battery is used to get an electric current in the appliance and in some appliances the electric current can only go in a specific direction through the appliance. To prevent the appliance from being damaged, the battery must be inserted in the correct direction. Light bulbs Light bulb Did you know? In 1879 Thomas Edison invented the first light bulb. Think of all the changes it has brought to our world today! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1652018/05/02 3:58:51 PM Energy and change and systems and control166 The battery is the source of energy. Some of the energy is transported through the electric wires to the thin wire inside the bulb. The thin wire becomes hot and emits (gives off) light. The energy is transferred in the thin wire to produce heat and light. So, chemical energy in the battery is changed into electrical energy, and then into light and heat energy in the bulb. ACTIVITY 12.5: Looking at electric wires MATERIALS: • Pieces of electrical wire • Scissors to strip some plastic at the end INSTRUCTIONS: Carefully examine the inside and outside of your wire. Or else look at the photo. The end of this wire has been stripped of the plastic. QUESTIONS: 1. What is on the inside and outside of the wire? 2. Why does the wire have different materials on the inside and the outside? What are the functions of the inside and outside materials? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1662018/05/02 3:58:51 PM 167Chapter 12: Electric circuits167 We have already discussed and constructed a switch, but a light switch in a building looks different. Light switch QUESTIONS Describe in words how you think a light switch in a house works. Hint: Look again at how we made a switch with a paper clip in Activity 12.3 on page 160. 12.2 Circuit diagrams If we want to keep a record of how we constructed a specific electric circuit, we could take a photo of it. Or we could remember the circuit by drawing a sketch. Look at the sketch that Mothusi drew of the circuit you made in Activity 12.3 with the paperclip switch. Simple circuit with a paperclip switch, cell and bulb NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1672018/05/02 3:58:51 PM Energy and change and systems and control168 Hey, but I can’t draw as well as Mothusi! It would take me forever to draw a sketch of the circuit we made in class! That’s right Phumlani, it takes time to draw a sketch like the one that Mothusi drew. It will take even longer if we add more components to a circuit. We could have more than one bulb like in the case of all the lights in your home. There could be also more than one switch. Each light in your home has its own switch. As Phumlani pointed out, all of us do not draw equally well! To save time and to avoid bad sketches, scientists came up with a way of representing the components of a circuit with special symbols. These standard symbols are used all over the world. They help scientists, engineers and technicians draw or record circuits quickly. It also helps everybody to understand the circuit in the same way. The table shows the sketch Mothusi drew and the symbol for each of the components of our circuit.

That’s much better! I can definitely draw these easy symbols for circuit diagrams! QUESTIONS Draw a circuit diagram for the sketch on page 167. Use the symbols in the table above for the components. Compare your diagram with the one below. You might have drawn a diagram like this: NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1702018/05/02 3:58:53 PM 171Chapter 12: Electric circuits171 For electric circuit diagrams we represent the wires with straight lines: This is a simple and quick way to represent an electric circuit. It should be clear to everyone that this circuit has a cell, a bulb and a switch, all connected with electric wires. Although we draw the wires as straight lines in a circuit diagram, in real life the wires are not straight. Just think of the electric wires that are attached to the appliances in your home, like to the kettle, lamp, vacuum cleaner or the computer.

We use electric wires in electric circuits. Did you have a close look at the wire? Did you notice what materials are used on the inside and outside of the wire? We should also know why two different materials make up an electrical wire. 13.1 What are conductors and insulators? We can say that a material or object conducts electricity or it does not. But what does this mean? Let’s do an investigation to find out. To do this we are going to use a simple circuit. We will connect pieces of different materials into a closed circuit with a light bulb in it. We can easily see if the material is a conductor.

ObservationPredictionInterpretation Bulb lights up Bulb does not light up 1. What do the objects that lit up the bulb have in common? 2. What do all the objects that did not light up the bulb have in common? CONCLUSION: Write a conclusion for this investigation in your exercise books. If the circuit is closed, the bulb lights up. We have learnt before that in such a case there is an electric current in the circuit. A material that allows a pathway for an electric current is called an electrical conductor. The material conducts electricity. QUESTIONS What type of materials did not light up the bulb? Although the circuit seemed closed, the bulb did not light up. What does that mean? In this case the path for the electric current is broken. We call a material that does not allow a pathway for an electric current an insulator. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1802018/05/02 3:58:55 PM 181Chapter 13: Electrical conductors and insulators181 13.2 Good electrical conductors and insulators We have seen in Activity 13.1 that the most familiar conductors are metals. Copper is the most common material used for electrical wiring. Silver is the best conductor, which means it is the material that makes it the easiest for electric current to flow through it. But silver is expensive. Gold does not rust and is used when high-quality contacts are needed. Although aluminium is a metal, it is not a very good conductor. However, it is sometimes used where weight is a consideration. Aluminium is not as heavy as copper. Our bodies are also good conductors of electricity. This is why an electric current can easily flow through you and into the Earth, giving you a shock. This is because our bodies are made up mostly of water with salts in it. Water with other substances in it, such as salt, is a good conductor of electricity. All conductors can allow current to flow through them if there is enough electrical energy. Normally the energy is too low. The plastic insulation on an electric cord is like this. Rubber gloves and shoes will protect you from mains electric current but not from lightning where the energy is very high. Conductors and insulators are opposites! • A good conductor is a bad insulator. • A good insulator is a bad conductor. The importance of electrical insulators Think of the electric wires that you use in class for the activities. Why do you think they are covered in plastic? The plastic is an insulator and therefore prevents you from getting a shock. The plastic acts as a barrier so that you can still touch the wire, but you will not get a shock from the electricity when the circuit is closed, as the plastic coating prevents this. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1812018/05/02 3:58:55 PM Energy and change and systems and control182 Electrical insulators are also used in other places. Have you ever looked up at power lines or telephone lines? You will see that the poles that carry the lines are sometimes made of wood. Wood does not conduct electricity so the electricity can therefore not flow from the wires into the pole. You may also see little white or coloured caps holding the wires as in the photo below. These caps are ceramic, which also does not conduct electricity. In this photo, the wooden poles and white ceramic caps are electrical insulators. It may be especially important to have ceramic electrical insulators between two different metal conductors. This is to prevent electricity from flowing between the different parts, such as in the photo below. Can you see the dark red-brown ceramic electrical insulators? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1822018/05/02 3:58:55 PM 183Chapter 13: Electrical conductors and insulators183 QUESTIONS Look at the picture of a bulb below. Explain why you think the piece separating the electric metal pins (conductors) is made of glass. Electric metal pin Glass Electricians are people whose job it is to work with electricity and fix the wiring in houses and other buildings. Electricians often wear rubber gloves to protect themselves from getting a shock. Rubber is an electrical insulator. KEY CONCEPTS • Some materials allow electric current to flow through them. They are called conductors. • Some materials do not allow electric current to flow through them. They are called insulators. • Metals are usually conductors and non-metals are usually insulators. • Electrical insulators have important functions like insulating wires or protection from electrical shock, an electrician’s rubber gloves for example.

Let us imagine our world of today without electricity! ACTIVITY 14.1: A world without electricity INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Write a short paragraph of how our world would be without electricity. 2. Describe the three things that will be the biggest disaster for you if there was no electricity. 3. Would there be any advantages of not having electricity? Discuss this with your classmates and write your answer in your exercise books. 4. Your group should now compare the advantages and disadvantages of electricity. What is the group’s conclusion, a yes or no for electricity? Write down your group’s reasons for saying yes or no. Electric circuits are often used to solve a problem where we need energy. A battery or mains supply is a source of energy. The energy is transported to a device or an appliance using electric wires. The device or appliance changes the electrical energy to another form, such as NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1852018/05/02 3:58:56 PM Energy and change and systems and control186 light energy, sound energy, heat energy or movement energy. We call this an energy transformation. One form of energy is changed into another form. Appliances can do this job for us. A system is something that consists of different parts working together to form a whole. In an electric system, there is an input (electrical energy) and an output (such as light, heat, movement or sound energy.) Let’s look at some examples of electric systems where we use the output energy to do something useful. ACTIVITY 14.2: Electric circuits influence our lives INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the photos in the table below. 2. Name the appliance or device. 3. Say what it is used for and what the energy is transformed to (light, sound, heat or movement)? In some cases it might be more than one thing! a.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy b.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy 1 NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1862018/05/02 3:58:56 PM 187Chapter 14: Systems to solve problems187 c.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy d.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy e.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy f.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy 2 NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1872018/05/02 3:58:56 PM Energy and change and systems and control188 g.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy h.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy i.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy j.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy 3 NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1882018/05/02 3:58:57 PM 189Chapter 14: Systems to solve problems189 k.Name: Use: Energy transformed from energy to energy Each of the examples in Activity 14.2 uses an electric circuit to provide us with energy where we need it, whether it is light on the street, sound for our radio, or heat in a building. Or even in some toys and models such as a car racing game, or model electric train set! We can say that electrical appliances can solve problems for us. They are able to transform electrical energy into another useful form of energy. 14.2 Be an electrical engineer or electrician Let’s say you want to become an electrical engineer or electrician. One of the things that you will be doing is to design systems that use circuits to solve problems for people, whether it is the wiring in a house, an alarm bell, a lighthouse on the coast, or constructing toys which use electrical energy to work. Wow, I would love to be an electrical engineer! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1892018/05/02 3:58:57 PM Energy and change and systems and control190 ACTIVITY 14.3: Design, make and present a system using a circuit DESIGN BRIEF: You are an electrical engineer and you need to come up with a design for an electrical system to solve a problem. You need to design and make a system that uses a circuit to produce movement, light, sound or heat. Write a design brief where you identify what you are going to make and why it needs an electric circuit. INVESTIGATE: The next step in the design process is to do some research about the device that you are going to make. You can use books and the internet to do your research. Answer these questions when doing research about your electrical system: 1. How is this system normally made? 2. What components does it need? 3. What type of energy will be produced from electrical energy? 4. Why do people need this system? What problem does it solve? DESIGN: Now that you know a bit more about the system you want to make you need to design how you are going to make it. Your system has the following specifications: • The system must make use of an electric circuit. • The system must produce either movement, sound, light or heat. • The circuit must make use of some of the components that you have learned about, such as cells, light bulbs, switches, wires, etc. • Your system must make use of a switch to turn it on and off. Your system has the following constraints: • You must make it in class. • You cannot get an adult electrician to design your project for you! You must come up with your own design. • Your system is not life-sized, but must be a model. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1902018/05/02 3:58:57 PM 191Chapter 14: Systems to solve problems191 Answer these questions: 1. What materials will you need to make it? For example, which electrical components will you need? Which other materials will you need, such as a cardboard box to put the system in, adhesive tape or Prestik, drawing pins or paint to paint the box? 2. What tools will you need to make it? Such as pliers to cut the wire and scissors to cut cardboard. Make a list and collect some of these items from home, or else ask your teacher if he/she has any. 3. How many cells (batteries) will you need for your circuit? 4. Where will you place the switch? What type of switch are you going to make? Now you need to draw some designs for your system. Use scrap pieces of paper to do your first designs. Once you are happy with your design, draw your design in your exercise books. Label your drawing, showing what materials you are going to use for the different parts. When you are making your system you might get better ideas to improve the design as you test it out to see if it produces the required output. So come back afterwards and draw what you really decided to make. MAKE: Now make your system! After you have all finished making your systems, perhaps go around and look at what others have done. Ask questions to see what you can learn from each other. You will also have to present your project to the class so use this time to get ideas about how to present your idea and product that you made. EVALUATE: Before we get on to presenting the projects, you need to evaluate your own project. You can then use this evaluation in your presentation to show others what worked and did not work. 1. Does your system look like your initial design? 2. Does your system produce a movement, sound, light or heat? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1912018/05/02 3:58:57 PM Energy and change and systems and control192 3. Where would people use the system you designed to solve a problem in their daily lives? 4. Is there anything you might do differently to improve your design? COMMUNICATE: Engineers need to be able to present their designs to show others what they have come up and communicate their ideas. Engineers can present a written report and hand in their design drawings. But, often an engineer will need to present the design and project by giving a verbal report. Your last task in this design project is to present your system to your class. These are your instructions: 1. Present an oral report to the rest of the class to tell them about the system that you built. 2. You must have your system with you in the front of the class and show how it works. 3. You must explain the electric circuit that is used and what type of energy is produced. 4. Tell the class how your system could be used by people and why they might value your design. For example, how it could be used in a house by people or how it could form a new toy on the market. 5. Lastly, tell the class what you learned by doing this project and anything that you found tricky or difficult, or that you might change if you had to do it again. KEY CONCEPTS • Electric circuits solve problems like getting electric lighting for example. • There are many instances in the world around us where electric circuits are used, such as street lighting, alarms, electric gates, traffic lights, fans and heaters, and some models and toys. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1922018/05/02 3:58:57 PM 193Chapter 14: Systems to solve problems193 REVISION 1. Name five things that we would not be able to do without using electricity. Explain why you think each of these things is important to us. 2. Phumlani builds an electric circuit that includes a bulb and battery for his bedside table so that he can read at night, but the bulb does not light up. List three things that could be wrong. 3. Phumlani does not want the battery in his bedside light to run out of energy. What could he do? 4. List three electrical devices that use energy from a battery. 5. List three electrical devices that use energy from a mains supply. 6. Draw an electric circuit diagram for the system that you designed and made in the design project. We have now seen how to make simple circuits and use a circuit to do something for us. But how do we get electricity in our homes, school and shops? Let’s find out! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1932018/05/02 3:58:58 PM 194 15 Mains electricity KEY QUESTIONS • Where does mains electricity come from? • What are fossil fuels and how did they form underground? • Why should we save energy and how can we do it? • Why are illegal electrical connections so dangerous? • What is the difference between renewable and non- renewable energy resources? We are so used to switching on electrical appliances that we hardly think what makes it possible to have these things. Our focus turns to appliances that need a mains electrical supply. You have listed examples like a television, a computer, a kettle and many others before. The big question here is: “Where does mains electricity come from?” 15.1 Fossil fuels and electricity Do you remember learning about fossil fuels and power stations in Grade 5? A battery has stored energy which can be changed into electrical energy. However, our homes, schools, shops and factories cannot run on batteries because they cannot store or provide large amounts of energy. Electricity does a lot of work for us and is used every day. The main supplier of electrical energy is from power stations. We call this mains electricity. But power stations also need a source of energy to make electricity. In South Africa, this is mostly sourced by burning fossil fuels, especially coal. New words • mains electricity • power supply • power station • turbine • generator • renewable • non-renewable NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1942018/05/02 3:58:58 PM 195Chapter 15: Mains electricity195 What are fossil fuels? Coal, oil and natural gas are fossil fuels. Some people think that fossil fuels are the remains of dead dinosaurs, but this is not true! Actually, most of the fossil fuels we find today were formed millions of years before even the first dinosaurs. Fossil fuels were once alive! QUESTIONS Do you remember learning about fossils in Grade 5 in Earth and Beyond? Write down what you think a fossil is. So fossil fuels are actually the remains of prehistoric organisms that lived millions of years ago! Wow, that’s amazing! So the coal we burn was actually once a real tree millions of years ago? Yes, that is right Phumlani. But different fossil fuels come come from different organisms and are formed in slightly different ways. Visit How fossil fuels are made. goo.gl/5XGW5 NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1952018/05/02 3:58:58 PM Energy and change and systems and control196 ACTIVITY 15.1: Let’s take a trip back in time, millions of years ago! INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Read the text below about how fossil fuels were formed and study the pictures. 2. Then answer the questions that follow. 300 million years ago ... Think about what the Earth must have looked like back then! There were swamps and marshes everywhere and it was warmer than it is today. Ancient trees, ferns and plants grew everywhere. Very weird looking animals roamed the earth, and even stranger looking fish lived in the rivers, and deep in the oceans and seas. An ancient, prehistoric world When these prehistoric plants and animals died their bodies decomposed just in the same way as organisms decompose today. The dead organisms became buried under layers and layers of mud, rock, sand and water. Over time, these layers built up and became very deep, and they pushed down with a great pressure on the layers below. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1962018/05/02 3:58:58 PM 197Chapter 15: Mains electricity197 Millions of years passed, and the dead plants and animals slowly decomposed and formed fossil fuels. Different types of fossil fuels were formed, depending on different factors. For example, whether it was the remains of plants or animals, or a combination, and how long the remains of the organisms had been buried for. The type of fossil fuels that formed also depended on the temperature and pressure conditions during the decay of the organisms. Oil and natural gas Oil is a dark, thick liquid that can be used to make petrol to burn in vehicles, such as cars, buses and trucks. Natural gas is a colourless gas, and it is used mostly in homes for heating and cooking food. TrilobitesLimulus CeratodusAmmonoids NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1972018/05/02 3:58:59 PM Energy and change and systems and control198 Oil and natural gas formed from organisms (plants and animals) that lived in the oceans before there were dinosaurs. When these organisms died, they settled on the bottom of the riverbed or ocean floor, and the layers built up under mud and sand (silt). The mud and sand slowly changed into rock, and the rock and water pressure pushed down on the remains of the dead plants and animals. Over millions of years of being under heat and pressure, the dead plants and animals changed into a thick liquid, called crude oil. In deeper, hotter places tiny bubbles of natural gas formed. These were trapped under the rocks. Over time, some of the oil and natural gas began to work its way up through the rock and to the Earth’s crust, and into rock formations called caprocks. Today, most of the oil and natural gas is collected from these caprocks by drilling down through the layers of rock. OCEAN 300 million years ago OCEAN 100 million years ago Sand and silt rock Sand and silt Plant and animal remains Oil and gas deposits Coal Coal is a black rock that can be burnt to produce energy in power stations all over the world. Coal was formed from the dead remains of trees, ferns and some other plants that lived 300 to 400 million years ago. This was when the Earth was mostly covered in swampy forests. These kinds of plants were very different to the plants that we get today. Over time, the layers of dead plants at the bottom of swamps was covered with layers of water and mud. The top layers compressed down on the dead plants. Over millions of years the heat and pressure turned the plants into coal, which we mine today. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1982018/05/02 3:58:59 PM 199Chapter 15: Mains electricity199 Ferns were very common in the prehistoric world of plants. 1 Much of the Earth was covered in swamps millions of years ago. The energy in coal originally comes from energy from the sun. Plants on Earth used the energy of the sun for photosynthesis and to grow. This energy was stored in the leaves, flowers and stems of the plants. As the plants died the energy was trapped. Rocks and dirt Coal Dead plants Dirt SWAMP 300 million years ago WATER 100 million years ago QUESTIONS: 1. What are the three fossil fuels discussed in the text? 2. The organisms that fossil fuels were formed from lived many years ago, and are different to the organisms that we get today. How many millions of years ago was this? 3. The dead organisms were covered with sediments over time. Do you remember learning about sediments in Grade 5 Earth and Beyond, and how sedimentary rock forms? Write a description of what deposition is. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 1992018/05/02 3:58:59 PM Energy and change and systems and control200 4. What are the two main factors, which turned the remains of organisms into fossil fuels deep under the layers of rock and mud? 5. Explain why we say that all our energy originally comes from the sun, even in fossil fuels. 6. Do you remember learning about the states of matter in Matter and Materials? Each of the three fossil fuels discussed here is in a different state of matter. Say what they are. 7. The process of coal formation, and natural gas and oil formation, have similarities but also differences. Draw a table where you compare these two processes. Give your table a heading. The way we obtain the different fossil fuels is also different. Coal is usually obtained by digging mines into the rock and sand to reach the coal deposits deep under the surface. This creates a huge hole in the surface of the Earth as you can see in the photograph of a coal mine below. Oil and natural gas is obtained by drilling down through the rock. A hole is sunk with a huge drill so that the oil and natural gas can be reached, and then brought up to the surface. This normally takes place in the ocean, as you can see in the photo of an oil rig below. Coal mine 2 An oil rig in the ocean, which sinks a drill into the ocean floor to reach the oil deposits.

Find out which three countries use the most fossil fuels. So we have spoken about fossil fuels and energy, but how do we then get electrical energy from fossil fuels? That is a great question, Phumlani! A good scientist always asks questions! Fossil fuels and electricity The main supplier of electricity in South Africa is Eskom. Eskom uses mainly coal to produce energy for industrial and household use. Let’s look at a power station to find out how coal is used to produce electricity. Look at the following diagram and the steps that outline the process to make electricity from coal: 1. Coal is transported from a coal mine to a power station. 2. At the power station, the coal is ground into a fine powder (pulverised) NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2012018/05/02 3:59:00 PM Energy and change and systems and control202 3. The ground coal then goes into a container where it is burned. 4. The heat generated from the burning coal is used to boil water in a huge boiler. 5. The boiling water produces steam that turns a turbine (a turbine is a big wheel which turns). 6. The turbine is linked to a generator, which uses a coil to produce energy. 7. From the generator the electric current is transported (carried) by a system of electrical transmission lines (also called power lines) to substations near our homes. 1. Coal mine 2. Pulveriser 4. Boiler 3. 5. Turbine 6. Generator 7. Sub- station The process of making electricity from coal in a power station. ACTIVITY 15.2: Make a poster to trace the source of our electricity MATERIALS: • Poster-size paper or cardboard • Colour pens or pencils INSTRUCTIONS 1. Design and make a poster for your classroom on which you illustrate the chain of objects and processes that allow us to use an appliance in our homes (such as a television set, stove or refrigerator). NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2022018/05/02 3:59:00 PM 203Chapter 15: Mains electricity203 2. Start with a picture or drawing of the sun in the top left corner and end with the appliance in the bottom right corner of the poster. 3. Use arrows to show the sequence of objects and processes. 4. Label each object or process on your poster. 5. Decide on a heading for your poster and write it in big letters at the top. Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources of energy. This is because they take millions of years to form. Once these fuels are burnt, they cannot be recovered or re-used. They are non-renewable. People on Earth are using up these deposits of fossil fuels much, much faster than they are being made as they take millions of years to be made! Look at the diagram of a power station on page 202 again. Do you see the smoke that is given off when the coal is burnt? This causes huge environmental concerns as it is polluting our atmosphere. A bit later in this chapter we will look at other ways of producing energy which, unlike fossil fuels, are renewable. 15.2 Cost of electricity Do you hear your parents and other adults talk about the cost of living? Do they remind you to switch off lights and other appliances that are not in use? Electricity is an expensive resource! Why is electricity expensive? Electricity is costly for various reasons: • The production and delivery of electricity requires infrastructure (the structures and facilities), like coal mines, trucks and trains to transport coal, power stations, substations and wiring. • All of these buildings, structures, materials and processes are very expensive to build and maintain. Did you know? The burning of coal produces billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that contributes to global warming. New words • infrastructure • kilowatt NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2032018/05/02 3:59:00 PM Energy and change and systems and control204 • Some electrical appliances require a lot of energy, much more than others. For example, a geyser uses a lot of electricity to heat the water, and so it becomes expensive. When electrical energy enters your home, it must pass through a meter. Have you ever seen a white box outside your house? This is the electricity meter. A worker from the city council reads the meter so that they will know how much electricity you used. They then bill you for the cost. The more electricity we use, the more we pay, and the more we use up fossil fuels. Some houses now have prepaid electricity meters where you pay for your electricity before you use it. Can you see the number recording the electricity usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) on this electricity meter? 3 Running electrical appliances We already mentioned that some electrical appliances use more electricity to run than others. Appliances that heat use the most energy, such as a geyser or heater. How do we know which electrical appliances use more electricity? Let’s find out! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2042018/05/02 3:59:01 PM 205Chapter 15: Mains electricity205 ACTIVITY 15.3: Finding out how much energy appliances and devices use INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Find the appliances or devices listed in the table below. If you do not have them in your home or school, ask family, friends or neighbours if you could look at theirs. 2. Have a look at each appliance and check for a label with information like the one below. This information is usually at the back or the bottom of the appliance. 230 V – 240 V; 50 Hz; 2 kW 3. Copy the following table in your exercise books. Record the number that is followed by a W or kW on the label in column 2 of the table. This number indicates how much energy is required by the device in a certain time. It is called the power required by the device. We measure power in watt (W) or kilowatt (kW). The higher the value the more energy the device uses in a specific time. 4. Add any other three appliances or devices to the list. 5. Record all the power values in column 3 in watt. If the power is given in kW, multiply this number by 1 000 to get the value in watt (W). If the device does not show a value in W or kW, look for two quantities given in volt (V) and milliampere (mA). Multiply these two numbers and then divide the answer by 1 000 to get the power in watt.

Now arrange the appliances in the next table in terms of the power required. The list should be from small to large values of the power. Appliance or devicePower in watt (W) QUESTIONS: 1. What do you see in this table? Which two appliances have the lowest power requirements? What do these appliances have in common? 2. Which two appliances have the highest power requirements? What do these appliances have in common?

Good for her, Phumlani! Electricity is expensive so we should try and save electricity. QUESTIONS This is not the only reason to try save electricity. Remember when we spoke about the pollution given off by coal power stations? Why else do you think it is important to try save energy and reduce your power usage? There are many different ways to save electricity, from small actions, to larger actions, such as using renewable energy resources. We will discuss this a bit later in the chapter. QUESTIONS How can you prevent wastage of electricity in your home? Name four possible ways.

It is illegal for anyone to use electricity that was generated by Eskom without their permission. Some people make illegal connections because they don’t want to pay for the electricity. They cut through the insulation in a power line and attach other cables to this line. They can then direct some electricity to their house or workplace. These connections are dangerous to people as they are often unsafe. People who make illegal connections try to get electricity for free but the dangers are not worth it. It is not worth your life! Look at this mess of illegal electrical connections. 4 Accidents caused by electricity happen all the time. People often get hurt or even killed by electricity because they do not use it safely. Not only is it important to know how to use electricity safely, but also what to do if someone is hurt or shocked by electricity.

What safety rules can you formulate regarding using electrical appliances outside in the garden? 15.4 Renewable ways to generate electricity We have learnt that fossil fuels are non-renewable resources of energy. QUESTIONS What do you understand by the word ‘non-renewable’? So, if we are using an energy resource that is non- renewable, then this will be a problem in the future when these resources run out. Are there other sources of energy? Scientists and engineers are looking for ways to harness energy from renewable resources. A renewable resource is the opposite to a non-renewable resource. It will not run out and can be used over and over. Renewable energy sources include natural phenomena, such as sunlight, wind, tides and plant growth. The energy comes from natural processes that happen over and over. Visit Renewable energy (video). goo.gl/wKyHB NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2122018/05/02 3:59:02 PM 213Chapter 15: Mains electricity213 Examples of renewable energy resources: • Solar (energy from the sun) • Wind • Ocean (tides and waves) • Hydropower (waterfalls or freshwater dams) • Biomass (energy from plants and other organic material) • Geothermal (energy from steam underneath the surface of the Earth) QUESTIONS Why do you think natural phenomena, such as sunlight and wind, can be considered as renewable? Sun, wind and water can be used as sources of energy. Solar panels can be fitted to houses but this source of renewable energy is only available on sunny days. Wind energy can be collected with a windmill or wind-turbine, which can be big and noisy. Hydroelectric power stations harness the energy in water stored in dams. It is only possible in areas where there are high mountains and rivers. Wind turbines use wind to generate electricity. New words • hydropower • biomass • geothermal Did you know? The first windmills were developed in Persia in about 600 bc. But the first windmill to produce electricity was in Denmark in 1890.

As the water flows from the higher dam, through the station to the lower dam, electricity is made. 5 What are the advantages and disadvantages of renewable and non-renewable sources? There is a lot of debate around the use of renewable and non-renewable sources for energy. Let’s join this debate! Did you know? Solar panels which convert the sunlight energy to produce electrical energy are also called photovoltaics. There are also solar water heaters, but this is a different system to solar panels. Solar heaters directly heat water.

Last year, in Grade 5 we mostly looked at Earth and the features of Earth. Now we are going to explore space a bit more! Before carrying on, let’s refresh our memories on some of the things about space from Grade 4. ACTIVITY 16.1: Wordsearch about space INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Find the following words in the wordsearch. 2.

Our solar system is made up of the sun and the planets. Let’s take a look! What is the sun? The sun glows so fiercely that it is not safe to look straight at it, even though it is so far away. The sun is a ball of gases. The sun is extremely hot: The temperature is about 15 000 000 degrees Celsius (°C) in the centre! The surface is about 5 500 °C. Can you see the explosion from the surface of the sun in the photo? Can you see the big burst of gas from the sun on the bottom left? The sun is a star, because it produces its own energy. The sun appears bigger and brighter because it is much nearer to earth than the other stars. The sun is about 420 times bigger than the Earth and about 1 700 times bigger than the moon! The sun is much further away than the moon from the Earth. The sun produces light and heat, which warms the surface of the Earth.

Photosphere Convection zone Radiation zone Core Sunspots This image shows the different layers of the sun. ACTIVITY 16.2: Looking at the structure of the sun INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the picture of the sun showing the different layers inside. 2. Answer the questions. QUESTIONS: 1. Which is the hottest part of the sun? 2. The sun’s energy comes from burning gases being squeezed together (compressed) until hydrogen turns into helium. Where do you think the gases are compressed the hardest? 3. What are the dark spots on the surface of the sun called? Did you know? When the sun has changed all its hydrogen into helium and other substances, it will begin to die. But we need not worry, because that will happen 10 000 million years from now. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2222018/05/02 3:59:06 PM 223Chapter 16: The solar system223 Come with me! We are going to hear a story about the planets. It’s a bit of Science, Maths and History all mixed up! Constellations and planets Long, long ago people watched the stars at night. Shepherds looking after their sheep and cattle would lie down and look up at the night sky. People in hot countries slept on the roofs of their houses. So they had plenty of time to look at the stars. They knew the patterns of stars in the sky and how the stars moved across the sky during the night. The patterns were fixed (they did not change). For example, you can find a pattern like the Southern Cross if you look up towards the south. You can see it in the first photo below. The second photo with white lines helps you to see the cross pattern. It always looks the same because the stars are always the same distance apart. Southern Cross Pointer stars This pattern of stars is the The white lines are not really Southern Cross. The pattern in the sky, they just show you does not change. how to view the Southern Cross. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2232018/05/02 3:59:06 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control224 Patterns of grouped stars are called constellations. The next pictures show some other famous constellations of stars, which you can see in the night sky. Some well-known constellations of stars in the night sky Long ago people noticed that some bright objects did not behave like the others. These objects came close to a star one night and then the next night, at the same time, the object had moved away from the star. Night after night, these objects appeared in new positions among the stars. The Greeks of those ancient times called these objects ‘the wanderers’ because they were in a slightly different position each night. The Greek word for wanderer is planetes and so we get the English word ‘planet’. A person who wanders is someone who walks around wherever they feel like going. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2242018/05/02 3:59:06 PM 225Chapter 16: The solar system225 The planets were a science puzzle People who study the stars are called astronomers. The planets were a puzzle for ancient astronomers. Why did they move differently to the stars? Were they just as far away as the stars? Why were they brighter at some times of the year than at other times? You can see the planet Venus just after the sun has set. Venus is usually very bright. At some times of the year, you have to look for Venus in the dark sky where the sun will rise. The ancient peoples gave names to the planets. For example, Mars was named after the god of war. One planet was so beautiful that they called it Venus after the goddess of love and beauty. You can see Mars at some times of the year. Mars is orange-red, and at most times it looks smaller than Venus. It is not as easy to find as Venus is. Sometimes you have to look late at night to see Mars rising in the east. How astronomers solved the puzzle Over hundreds of years, astronomers set up observatories in places like India, Egypt, Iraq, England and countries in Europe. An observatory is a building that has permanent measuring marks. These marks are always in the same position. The astronomers make notes of where stars and planets are compared to these fixed positions, and they note the dates and times. Did you know? A system is a set of parts that work together. Any change or movement in one part causes changes in the other parts. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2252018/05/02 3:59:07 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control226 Hypatia was an astronomer and mathematician at the University of Alexandria in Egypt. She lived about 1 700 years ago. Can you see the globe next to her? Over many years of careful observing, the astronomers kept records of where the planets moved. They used Maths to predict where a planet would be on a future date. Then on that date they went to check if their prediction was correct. They became very good at measuring, doing Maths and doing calculations with big numbers. Ancient astronomers made observations. So they worked out that the planets are closer to us than the stars, and that the planets are moving around the sun. Then they realised that Earth is a planet too, and it is moving around the sun!

Nowadays we know exactly where each planet is at any time, and we can actually send spacecraft to the planets. The sun together with the planets moving around it is called the solar system. You will learn about that next. The solar system The solar system consists of the sun and all the planets that orbit around it. It also includes asteroids and the planets’ moons. Below you can see a diagram of the solar system. In Activity 16.3 on page 228 you can see another diagram of the solar system. Both these diagrams try to show you what the solar system is like. Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune The solar system consisting of the sun and eight planets. In the solar system, each object’s force of gravity pulls on all the other objects. Gravity is a force of attraction between objects. The sun is the biggest and heaviest object in our solar system and so it exerts the greatest force of gravity on all the planets. This force of gravity makes all the planets move in circles around the sun. Visit The birth of the planets. goo.gl/Nr0eL Did you know? Pluto used to be classified as a planet but not anymore.

Could the planets really be as close to the sun as the picture below shows? Give some reasons for your answer. ACTIVITY 16.3: Looking at the solar system INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Imagine you are in a spacecraft very far from the Earth. You can see the planets all moving around the sun in orbits, like in the picture. The white lines in the picture show the path that each planet follows when orbiting the sun. These orbits (white lines) are not actually visible. 2. Look at the picture and answer the questions. Venus Mercury Mars Saturn Earth Jupiter Neptune Uranus Asteroid belt Sun The solar system showing the orbits of the planets. Did you know? The word ‘solar’ comes from the Latin word sol, which means sun. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2282018/05/02 3:59:07 PM 229Chapter 16: The solar system229 QUESTIONS: 1. Which planet is the closest to the sun? 2. Is Venus or Earth closer to the sun? 3. Write the names of the planets in order, beginning from the one that is closest to the sun. 4. Which planet do you think is the coldest, and why? 5. Why do the planets all keep on moving in orbits around the sun? Let’s now use our bodies to create a model of how the planets move around the sun! ACTIVITY 16.4: Make a model of two planets orbiting the sun MATERIALS: • Strong rope (about 5 m long) • Another strong rope (about 3 m long) • Two balls in plastic bags • Eight thick rubber bands • Small chair or box (plastic milk crate) INSTRUCTIONS (Part 1): 1. Tie four elastic bands onto the handles of the plastic bag. Then tie the 5 m rope onto the four elastic bands. Put one ball inside. 2. You are going to do as you see in the picture on page 230. 3. Someone must run with the ball in the bag to help you get it going. 4. Then swing the ball around as fast as you can, on the end of the rope. 5. The rest of the class must watch the plastic bag carefully to see whether the rubber bands stretch. 6. See the learner in the picture swinging the ball around himself. The learner represents the sun and the ball represents the Earth. 7. Take turns to swing the ball. Feel how hard you need to pull on the ball to keep it going around. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2292018/05/02 3:59:08 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control230 8. The people who are watching will see the rubber bands stretch. This means that the ball is pulling on the rope, and the rope is pulling on the ball. Ball inside Plastic bag Four elastic bands QUESTIONS: 1. What does the learner who is swinging the ball represent? What does the ball represent? 2. What do you feel is happening to the elastic as you swing the ball? 3. If the ball in its bag could feel, what would it feel? 4. If the string breaks, in what direction will the ball carry on travelling? 5. The ball represents the Earth. The learner swings it quite fast, but how long does the Earth really need to go once around the sun? INSTRUCTIONS (Part 2): 1. This part is more difficult and it needs some practice. You are still making a model of planets moving around the sun. 2. Use the 3 m rope and tie it onto a bag and ball as you did before. 3. In the next picture you see one learner standing on a stool and swinging another ball in a bag. 4. The first learner now has to walk around the stool to keep his ball moving. 5. This might take some time to get it right! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2302018/05/02 3:59:08 PM 231Chapter 16: The solar system231 Two learners must now swing balls at the same time. This is quite tricky! QUESTIONS: 1. Which part of this model represents the sun? 2. Which part of the model represents planet Earth? 3. Which part represents planet Venus? 4. In this model, when Earth revolves around once, how long a period of time does that represent? The planet Earth orbits around the sun in 365.25 days and we call that one year. As Earth moves to new positions around the sun, we have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring, and then summer comes again. Now in space, the Earth keeps on going around the sun at more than 100 000 kilometres in every hour. But there is no rope pulling on the Earth, so what keeps it moving? The force of gravity pulls the sun and the Earth towards each other. There is no rope in space between Earth and the sun! The Earth would move away, but the sun ‘traps’ the Earth with its much greater force of gravity. The sun pulls on the Earth and the Earth pulls on the sun with the force of gravity. The pull is so strong that it works at a distance of 150 million kilometres! Like the rope, the force of gravity keeps the Earth moving in its orbit around the sun, year after year. It does the same for the other planets too. The force of gravity pulls the planet Neptune into its orbit even though Neptune is 30 times further away from the sun than Earth is. Did you know? The planet Venus orbits around the sun in 224.7 days. Those are 224.7 Earth days.

We visit the eight planets The four inner planets are rocky. Look at the picture on page 228 of the solar system again. The four planets closest to the sun are called the inner planets of the solar system. They all are made of rock. Some of them have a thin layer of gas on the outside. Earth has a very thin layer of water and soil too. These are the four inner rocky planets. This picture shows their sizes compared to each other. Can you name them?

The four outer planets are gas giants. These planets are very far from the sun. They don’t have a hard surface that a spacecraft can land on. Instead, they are giant balls of very cold gases. Astronomers think that these planets have hot, solid cores, deep down inside them. This diagram shows the different sizes of the planets. Can you see how much bigger the four outer gas giants are?

Give the names of the four outer, gas planets by looking at the picture on page 233. 2. Give the name of one of the gases that make up the gas planets. Let’s now take a closer look at each of the planets. Mercury is closest to the sun, and the smallest planet. It has no atmosphere and its grey surface is marked with thousands of craters. A crater is the mark that we see where a rock has crashed onto a planet or a moon. The surface of Mercury. Can you see all the craters? Venus is second closest to the sun. It is almost the same size as Earth. To us, it looks white and it shines brightly in the evening or morning. Venus shines brightly like that because it is covered in a thick cloud of gas. It would be horrible to breathe the atmosphere on Venus, because the gas is mostly carbon dioxide and sulphuric acid! The atmosphere absorbs lots of heat from the sun and does not cool down at night. Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Did you know? Venus alternates every 584 days between being an ‘evening star’ and a ‘morning star’. In other words, shining brightest just after sunset, or just before sunrise. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2342018/05/02 3:59:09 PM 235Chapter 16: The solar system235 Venus rising next to the moon.

Earth has its moon that we know well. The moon moves in its orbit around the Earth. A satellite tracking a hurricane moving over Earth’s surface. Can you see the hurricane? It appears as the white swirl of cloud on the photo. Next furthest out is Mars, the red planet. Many spacecraft have been sent to Mars to take photographs and some spacecraft landed to take samples of the soil. So we know quite a lot about Mars. Mars needs almost two Earth years to complete one orbit around the sun, so if you lived on Mars you would have to wait a very long time for your birthday. Mars spins like the Earth, and a day on Mars is almost the same length as a day on Earth. A day on Mars is called a sol. Can you see the long, darker mark across the surface of Mars?

It has a thin atmosphere but this atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide gas. Humans cannot breathe that atmosphere. The surface is mostly sand and rocks. The sand is full of iron oxide, which is the same substance as red-orange rust. From Earth we see Mars as a small red-orange dot in the sky, because of the colour of the soil. There are some very big valleys on Mars. Valleys are caused by erosion when water flows downhill, so we can guess that there was a lot of water on the planet long ago. If there was water, perhaps there were living things on Mars too. But we cannot be sure. Scientists have sent another spacecraft to look carefully at the rocks and sand. The spacecraft is called Curiosity and it will try to find signs of living things in the ground. This is a very recent photograph of the surface of Mars, taken in 2012 by the rover called Curiosity. Can you see all the rocks? This is a closer view of the valley you saw on the surface of Mars. On Earth, valleys like this are caused by water. Did Mars have water long ago?

If your mass is 40 kg on Earth, you weigh 400 Newtons (N). If you went to Mars, what would you weigh? 2. Would you feel heavier or lighter on Mars? Now we have to go very far from the sun, five times further than Earth from the sun. We begin to see the gas giants, which are the four outer planets. These gas giants have no solid surface we could land on. They are huge balls of gas and if we came close we would fly through clouds of cold gases. Jupiter is the first gas giant we come to, and it is the biggest of all the planets. From Earth we see it shining white but close up, its colour is light pink-brown. It is bigger than all the other planets put together. Jupiter is a huge ball of gases, such as hydrogen, with clouds of ammonia. Winds blow from east to west on Jupiter’s surface, and they blow at the speed of jet planes. The surface is very cold, and some of the gases are so cold that they have become liquid or solid. Deep inside, Jupiter may have a very hot core of rock. Jupiter has four big moons, and sixty smaller ones. If we now go even further into space, to double the distance we went to reach Jupiter, we reach the planet Saturn. Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter but it has a light yellow colour. It is mostly gas and it has rings of rock spread out and spinning around it. Saturn has about 62 moons. Did you know?

Then we get Uranus, a smooth blue-green ball of gas, with almost no marks and shapes on it that we can see. It has more than 25 moons. The blue globe of Uranus shown here with five of its major moons. Now we are more than 30 times further from the sun than Earth is, and we see the last planet, Neptune. Neptune is also a ball of gas and looks like Uranus. It has about 12 moons, and possibly more. Neptune has a very ‘stormy’ surface. Images of the planet often show huge storms and winds. Did you know? You will read about Galileo in Chapter 20. He was the first person to see the moons of Jupiter. Did you know? Saturn isn’t the only planet with rings. The other gas giants, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune also have rings – they are just less obvious.

Maybe when we mentioned the asteroid belt? Let’s find out what they are! The asteroids are lumps of rock from planets that broke up long ago. Some of the lumps are bigger than a school building and some are only as big as small stones. They orbit around the sun and so they are travelling very fast. Some of them are travelling as fast as 25 kilometres every second. That is much faster than a bullet! This is a photo of the asteroids Ida and Gaspra. Ida is the bigger one and is 30 km long. Did you know? Many scientists believe that an asteroid hit Earth and caused the extinction of the dinosaurs around 65 million years ago. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2422018/05/02 3:59:11 PM 243Chapter 16: The solar system243 The asteroids have gathered together in a ring in the solar system. This ring is called the asteroid belt.

Use some of the words from the wordbox. Venus Mercury Mars Saturn Earth Jupiter Neptune Uranus Asteroid belt Sun • Mars • Jupiter • Venus • pieces of rock • in orbit • the sun Asteroids are that move around the sun. The asteroid belt is in space between the orbit of and the orbit of . In 1973, Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to travel to Jupiter. To get there, Pioneer 10 had to go through the asteroid belt. Do you remember how fast asteroids are moving? If an asteroid had hit Pioneer 10, the spacecraft would have been destroyed and smashed to pieces. However, space is a very big place and the asteroids are usually far apart. Pioneer 10 got through safely and went on to take the first close-up photos of Jupiter.

Earth’s moon Let’s begin with Earth’s moon. You learned about Earth’s moon in Grade 4. So what do we already know about Earth’s moon? ACTIVITY 16.7: Revising what we know about the moon QUESTIONS: 1. Does the moon make its own light? Explain how the moon gives us light at night. 2. Can we see the moon during the day? 3. Does the full moon look bigger when it rises at supper- time, and then smaller when it is high in the sky? 4. Why does the moon sometimes look like the letter D or the letter C? 5. Is it easier to see the stars when the moon is full or when it is not full? New words • crater • volcanoes • lava NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2442018/05/02 3:59:12 PM 245Chapter 16: The solar system245 6. Why do we sometimes see the new moon looking like this, in the next photo? The sun is almost behind the moon, so where is the light coming from? Only one side of the moon in this photo has light on it. Where is this light coming from? ACTIVITY 16.8: Comparing the moon with the Earth INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work with a partner or in a small group. 2. Look carefully at the picture and answer the questions. MoonEarth The moon and the Earth showing the difference in size. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2452018/05/02 3:59:12 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control246 QUESTIONS: 1. List all the differences you can see between the Earth and moon. 2. List some differences that you know about, even though you can’t see them in the picture. Many people say that the full moon looks bigger when it rises just after sunset, and then looks smaller late at night. Is this true? Let’s do an investigation to find out. INVESTIGATION 16.1: Does the moon look bigger when it rises than when it is high in the sky? AIM: What do you want to find out? HYPOTHESIS: What do you think will happen? APPARATUS: • Date when the moon will be full • Piece of wire shaped like a V (You can make this from a paper clip.) • Ruler METHOD: 1. Just after sunset on the right date, look for the rising moon. 2. When you see it coming up behind some trees or buildings, hold out your width-measure as you see in the picture below. Hold your width-measure at arm’s length. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2462018/05/02 3:59:13 PM 247Chapter 16: The solar system247 3. Bend the wires until the points (the tips) of the wire touch the sides of the moon. You must keep your arm straight while you measure the moon. Can you think of the reason why? 4. Go inside and use a ruler to measure how far apart the tips of the width-measure are. 5. Record your measurement in millimetres. 6. Go outside again about two hours later and measure the width of the moon a second time. Remember to keep your arm straight while you measure. 7. Come inside and use the ruler again. Measure the distance between the tips on your ruler again. 8. Record your measurement in millimetres. RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS: Width of the moon when it was touching the trees: mm. Width of the moon when it was high in the sky: mm. How could you have done this investigation better? CONCLUSION: Write down a conclusion about what you learnt from this investigation. The moon has a pale grey surface with dark grey marks on it. Nobody knew what the surface was like until a spacecraft landed on the moon. The first astronauts to walk on the moon stepped into fine, powdery dust. They collected rock samples (small pieces) to bring back to Earth. The footprint of the first person The surface of the moon. to ever stand on the moon. Can you see all the craters? Did you know? The footprints from the astronauts who first walked on the moon are still there! There is no wind on the moon to blow them away. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2472018/05/02 3:59:13 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control248 The surface of the moon is covered with holes called craters. These craters are made by space rocks that hit the moon. These rocks may be as small as grains of sand or as big as a house. They travel so fast that they explode when they hit the moon, and they make a round hole. The light-coloured areas on the moon are mountains, and the darker areas are plains. Some of these plains were made by huge space rocks that made craters 300 km wide. Other plains were made by volcanoes on the moon a long time ago. Lava flowed out from those volcanoes. Nowadays the moon has no volcanoes. The moon has no air so there is no wind to blow the dust. The moon has no water, so there is no rain to wash away sand and cause erosion. That is the reason why we see the craters on the moon so clearly. Moons of other planets Other planets have moons, too. On the following page is an image showing some of the moons in our solar system. Not all of them are shown here. They have been scaled to be the correct size compared to Earth and our moon. Mars has two moons, and astronomers called them Deimos and Phobos. Phobos has deep craters showing that it has also been hit by fast-moving rocks. Can you see how small these moons are compared to our moon? On the other hand, Jupiter has 66 moons, which we have identified. Each time humans send another space probe to Jupiter, more moons are being discovered! Only Jupiter’s four biggest moons are shown in the image on the next page. This image is only for enrichment. Did you know? A spacecraft a few years ago found signs of water frozen under the south pole of the moon. Scientists are not sure how the water got there.

The Earth is travelling through space at 100 000 km per hour. How can we work that out? Here is information for you to use: The length of the Earth’s path around the sun is 942 million km and it takes 365.25 days to go all the way around. Now you can work it out for yourself. Hint to help you: How many hours are there in one day? It is amazing to think that our planet is just one of eight in our solar system, and our solar system is one of millions in our galaxy! Let’s now find out about the movements of our planet in our solar system. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2522018/05/02 3:59:14 PM 253 17 Movement of the Earth and planets KEY QUESTIONS • If it is nighttime in South Africa, is it also nighttime in Brazil? • Do the other planets also take a year to revolve once around the sun? Is their year the same length as our year on Earth? • Why do we get daytime and nighttime? • What is the difference between revolution and rotation? 17.1 Rotation of the Earth For a long time people believed that the Earth stood still and the sun moved around the Earth. In this chapter we will find out what really happens. We’ll start by thinking about day and night. Day and night During the day, it appears as though the sun moves across the sky as it rises (comes up) in the morning and sets (goes down) in the evening. East and west are two directions you must know. If you point at the sun when it appears to rise in the morning, you are pointing in the direction of east. If you point at the place where the sun sets, you are pointing in the direction of west. Have a look at the picture of Felicity on page 254. It is sunrise in the morning and she is standing with her arms out pointing in the direction of east and west. New words • direction • rotate • rotation • axis of rotation Visit Short video showing the sun, Earth and moon system. goo.gl/hb4nS NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2532018/05/02 3:59:14 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control254 East direction South direction North direction West direction You can tell direction from the rising and setting of the sun. ACTIVITY 17.1: Finding east and west MATERIALS: A place where you can stand in the early morning. INSTRUCTIONS: Look at Felicity in the picture and answer the questions. QUESTIONS: 1. Which is Felicity’s right hand? Show her right hand with your finger. 2. Why do we see a shadow of Felicity on the ground? 3. In which direction is her shadow pointing? 4. If Felicity looks straight in front of her, in which direction is she looking? 5. Now find the direction of east in your classroom. You must point to the place where you see the sun come up in the morning. In the classroom, stretch out your arms and point in the direction of east and west. Clear the floor and stick some insulating tape on the floor so that everyone can remember which direction is east and which direction is west. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2542018/05/02 3:59:14 PM 255Chapter 17: Movement of the Earth and planets255 What does the word ‘direction’ mean? You can walk in a direction towards a place. If the wind blows, you see leaves moving in the same direction as the wind. Remember, a direction is not a place that you can reach! QUESTIONS Let’s have a discussion. To discuss something is to talk about it and your ideas with someone else or a group of people. Turn to your classmate next to you and discuss the following question. Write your answer down, then write your partner’s answer down. Where does the sun go at night? Why do we get day and night? Your answer is: My partner’s answer is: In this next section we will find out these answers! Does the sun really move, or does the Earth move? When you ride in a bus, you may see houses outside the bus. It looks as if the houses move past your window. To Felicity, who is riding in a bus, it looks like the houses are moving past. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2552018/05/02 3:59:15 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control256 QUESTIONS Why do the houses seem to move past your window? Are the houses really moving? Discuss these questions. So it is really the person in the bus who is moving. It looks to the person as though the houses are moving but they are not moving. You saw how big the sun is when we compare the Earth and the sun. Go back to the beginning of this term’s work to find the picture of the sun and the Earth (page 227). That great big sun does not move around the Earth. The Earth is spinning around and that is why we see the sun move past us. We are like Felicity in the bus. She is in the bus and she is moving past the houses. The sun is like the houses; they are not moving. It looks to us as though the sun is moving, but it’s really the Earth that is spinning around. You can think of the Earth as an orange with a pencil through it. The Earth spins like an orange on a pencil. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2562018/05/02 3:59:15 PM 257Chapter 17: Movement of the Earth and planets257 If you twist the pencil, the whole orange spins around. This is like the Earth spinning around. The pencil is called the axis of the orange. In the same way, we can think of an axis that goes through the Earth. The axis is a line that we can imagine, it is not a real thing. Earth spins around that axis. We say the Earth rotates (spins). We say that the Earth has an axis that it rotates on. This axis runs from the North Pole to the South Pole as you can see in the picture below. North Pole South Pole Other objects also have axes of rotation. For example, an ice skater has a vertical axis that she rotates on when spinning on a spot during her performance. A log which is floating in water can also roll around. It will have a horizontal axis of rotation. Different axes of rotation Vertical axis Horizontal axis NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2572018/05/02 3:59:16 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control258 ACTIVITY 17.2: Making a model of the Earth in daytime and night time MATERIALS: • Globe of the Earth (or a balloon with the shapes of the continents drawn on it) • String to hang a globe or balloon • Large mirror INSTRUCTIONS: 1. This picture shows you how to set up the equipment. 2. Set up a mirror outside the room so that it reflects bright sunlight onto the Earth globe. Your globe must be able to spin around. Real sun outside Large mirror String South Africa Everyone must look at the globe from the same side. A globe is a model of the Earth. 3. Everyone must look at the globe from the same side. 4. Find Africa on the globe. Turn the globe so that the sun’s light falls on South Africa. 5. One side of the globe is in shadow. Find the shadow in the picture. 6. Find where Durban and Cape Town are on the globe. 7. Look at the globe in the picture. If you were in Durban, would it be daytime or night time? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2582018/05/02 3:59:16 PM 259Chapter 17: Movement of the Earth and planets259 8. If you were in Cape Town, would it be daytime or night time? 9. Now turn the globe so that Africa moves to the right. That is, you turn the globe towards the east. You will see Durban becoming dark and moving into the shadow. When Durban is in night time, Cape Town will still be in sunlight. 10. Keep on turning the globe towards the east. Now Cape Town will go into the shadow. That is night time for the people in Cape Town 11. Which city will come back into daytime first, Cape Town or Durban? 12. Keep on turning the globe to the east, and Durban will come back into daytime. You have to move to the other side of the model to see Durban move into sunlight. 13. How many hours pass for the Earth to turn around once? We see the sun appears to rise and move across the sky every day. But the sun does not really move; it only seems to move! Earth is spinning round and round, and we are moving around with the Earth. The Earth takes 24 hours to complete one full rotation. Sun Light rays Earth DayNight Can you see how the light from the sun only reaches one half of the Earth as it rotates?

This model will help you to understand why we see the sun move across the sky. Do this in the early morning when the sun is still low. 2. We will say that your nose is Africa. You are on Africa. Look at the picture below. Light from the sun in the early morning Your left side T u r n t o y o u r l e f t s i d e Using your head as a model of the Earth. 3. Now stand so that bright light from the sun shines across your right cheek. 4. Turn slowly to your left. Turn your eyes towards the bright place where the sun is. You will see the sun move to your right while you move to the left. 5. Move your feet and turn further; you will see the sun ‘go down’ over your right cheek. 6. When you have turned your back to the sun, you cannot see the bright light any more. That is like night time in Africa. 7. Turn further to your left and you will see the sun ‘rise’ over your left cheek. That is like sunrise in Africa. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2602018/05/02 3:59:16 PM 261Chapter 17: Movement of the Earth and planets261 17.2 Revolution of the Earth By now you know that all the planets revolve (travel) around the sun. Each planet has its own pathway. This is called its orbit. We can also say planets orbit the sun. Earth also moves in its own orbit around the sun. This movement is called the revolution of the Earth around the sun. We can also say that the Earth orbits around the sun. We have now come across two new words: rotation and revolution. Remember, these are not the same thing! Let’s do an activity using our own bodies to understand the difference between revolution and rotation. ACTIVITY 17.4: Making a model of the Earth revolving around the sun MATERIALS: Room to move around INSTRUCTIONS: 1. We are going to use our bodies to understand the difference between revolving and rotating. 2. First, the whole class must spread out and stand on a spot. Now spin around with your arms out, staying on one spot. This is called rotation! The Earth rotates like this on its axis. 3. Now get into pairs. One learner must stand in one spot and the other learner must walk in a circle around the other person. This is revolution. The second learner is revolving around the learner standing still in the middle. The Earth revolves like this around the sun. 4. Now, let’s put both movements together! As the Earth rotates on its axis, it also revolves around the sun. This might be tricky! Spin around (rotate) while also moving in a big circle around your partner (revolve). Look at the picture on page 262. New words • revolve • revolution NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2612018/05/02 3:59:16 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control262 The learner is rotating (spinning) and revolving around his partner. QUESTIONS: 1. In this model, who represents the sun and who represents the Earth? 2. When you are spinning and walking in a circle around your partner, sometimes you face your partner and sometimes your back is to your partner. Which of these represents day for you and which represents night for you? 3. You could spin around very quickly. How many hours pass in reality for the Earth to rotate once? 4. You could move around your partner quite quickly. On the real Earth, how long does it take to go once around the sun? Did you know? Every four years we have a leap year, which is when there is one extra day in the year. This is because the Earth actually takes 365.25 days to revolve around the sun, and not just 365 days. So every four years, we have an extra day to account for these quarter days. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2622018/05/02 3:59:17 PM 263Chapter 17: Movement of the Earth and planets263 KEY CONCEPTS • Wherever we are, we can find the east – west direction by where the Sun rises and sets. • The Earth spins on its axis once in 24 hours. This spinning is called rotation. • The part of the Earth that faces the sun experiences daylight, and the part that is turned away from the sun experiences night. • The Earth travels in its orbit right around the sun. This travel in orbit is called revolution. • A complete travelling of the earth around the sun makes a year.

Why does it look as though the sun moves across the sky when we know that the sun does not move? 4. Where is the sun, when it is night time where we are? 5. When we are having night, is everybody in the world also having night? 6. The Earth spins on its own axis. What term refers to this? 7. The Earth and the other planets travel in an orbit around the sun. What term refers to this? 8. How many hours does it take the Earth to rotate once? 9. How many days does it take the Earth to revolve once around the sun? 10. Do you think Mars would take more Earth days to revolve around the sun than Earth does? Why? 11. Bonus question: Why do you think we have a leap year every four years and not every three or five years? We have now seen how our planet Earth moves, but what about our moon? Does it also rotate and revolve? Let’s find out! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2642018/05/02 3:59:17 PM 265 18 The movement of the moon KEY QUESTIONS • Does the moon move around the Earth? • Has anyone ever seen the far side of the moon? • What is a solar eclipse? 18.1 Rotation of the moon On Earth we see only one side of the moon. Nobody knew what the far side of the moon looked like until the Soviet Luna spacecraft went into orbit around the moon in 1959 and photo- graphed the far side. The force of gravity between the Earth and moon holds the moon’s near side facing us. ACTIVITY 18.1: So does the moon rotate? MATERIALS: • A white ball with a red mark on it • Learner to swing the ball around (see the picture) • Learner to observe the ball as it swings around INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Do as the learner in the picture is doing. Stretch out your arm and make the white ball revolve around your body by holding out your arm and moving around on a spot. Visit Video showing the movement of the moon. goo.gl/B9Jq8 The far side of the moon that we never see. This photo was taken by a spacecraft orbiting the moon.

Do you agree? 3. Your partner must stand on one side of you as you swing the ball around. What does this person see? They will see different sides of the ball. 4. Take it in turns to be the one moving the ball around as you rotate and the one observing. The learner represents the Earth and the white ball represents the moon. The learner swinging the ball always sees the same side of the ball, but a person standing watching the ball will say that it rotates. The red mark on the ball will point to the side of the room, then to the back of the room, then to the other side, and then to the front of the room. So the person watching will say that the ball has rotated, and also revolved. Our moon takes about 28 days to rotate once. Visit Do we always see the same side of the moon?

The moon takes about 28 days to complete one orbit. The force of gravity between the Earth and the moon holds the moon so that it always faces us on Earth. The moon revolves around the Earth. ACTIVITY 18.2: Make a model of the Earth and moon revolving around the sun MATERIALS: • White ball • Two people who have practised the model in the previous activity INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Work with the same partner. You must use your bodies and the white ball to act out this model of the Earth and moon revolving around the sun. 2.

So in reality the moon will be rotating on its own axis at the same time that it revolves around the earth. The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes 27.322 days for the moon to rotate on its own axis. As a result the moon does not seem to be spinning but looks like its keeping almost perfectly still from Earth. KEY CONCEPTS • The moon revolves in an orbit around the Earth in 27.322 days. • The moon rotates on an axis which also takes about 28 days. It rotates on its axis at the same speed as its revolution around the Earth. • We always see only one side of the moon. • Together, the Earth and moon revolve around the sun.

In Holland, a lot of the people were sailors and sea-explorers so they used their telescopes at sea to see if ships far away on the horizon were friends or maybe pirates. A telescope makes faraway things look bigger and closer. So a telescope is like a really big magnifying glass! Galileo Galilei was a professor of Mathematics at the University of Padua, Italy. In 1609 he heard that somebody in Holland had invented a telescope, and he worked out how to make one himself. New words • horizon • Milky Way • bright • magnify • lenses • distant • dishes • faint • galaxy • electromagnetic waves • square kilometre array • radio waves NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2702018/05/02 3:59:19 PM 271Chapter 19: Systems for looking into space271 Galileo Galilei’s telescope Galileo Galilei showing his looked like this. It could telescope to a group of only see a small part of scientists. the sky at a time. 1 Galileo used his telescope to look at the planets in the night sky, and he made careful notes of what he saw there. He was the first person to see that Jupiter had moons. He saw that Saturn has rings and he saw that Venus has phases like the moon has. He also used his telescope to show people that the Milky Way was really made of billions of stars. He wrote books that taught people about telescopes and what they could show us in the night sky. People can now buy telescopes like this to watch the stars from their own backyards. 2 Nowadays there are big telescopes in many parts of the world, and these telescopes have cameras to photograph the sky. Did you know? Galileo got into trouble with the authorities because they did not like what he wrote. They taught that the Earth was the centre of the universe and the sun, moon, stars and planets all revolved around the Earth. Galileo told people that was not true, and so he was put in jail.

Each point of light is a star. Telescopes have shown us that there are thousands of millions of stars that we could not see with our naked eyes. Some of those stars are so distant that their light has been travelling for millions of years to reach us. The Southern African Large Telescope One of the biggest telescopes in the world is here in South Africa, near the town of Sutherland. The telescope is called the Southern African Large Telescope or SALT. The telescope uses lenses and a very big mirror to see the stars and take photographs of them. This is SALT. Here the roof This photo is taken from inside is closed, but at night it the dome of SALT and shows opens so that the telescope the large mirror. can see the sky. Did you know? The biggest space telescope in the world is the Hubble Telescope, named after Edwin Hubble who first showed there were other galaxies besides our own, the Milky Wa y.

Or you can use the glass part of a light bulb, full of water. Your teacher will show you how to remove the inside parts of an old light bulb.) • Mirror for each group (It can be a small mirror, or you can make a mirror. You can glue the shiny foil from a potato-chip packet onto cardboard.) • Jar with lid • Candle • Chocolate A lens can make things If you look through a bottle or look bigger. glass of water, you will see how it makes things look bigger. INSTRUCTIONS (Part 1): 1. Hold up the lens and look at something on the wall. You can look at a poster, for example. 2. If you are far away from the wall, the poster will seem to be upside down. 3. When you come closer to the wall, the poster will be right way up and bigger. The lens is magnifying the poster (to magnify means to make bigger). QUESTIONS: 1. What do you notice about the shapes of lenses? 2. Why do you think this shape is necessary for the lens? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2732018/05/02 3:59:21 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control274 INSTRUCTIONS (Part 2): 1. Now the class must go outside into the sunshine. Take the lens and your mirror with you. This will work best on a hot, clear day. 2. Your teacher can point out a place on the wall that is in the shade. 3. Use your mirrors to reflect sunlight onto that spot. 4. The class can spread out; it does not matter where you stand. Just make sure you move your mirror so that it helps to light up the spot your teacher showed you. 5. If everyone reflects sunlight onto that one spot, it will become very bright there. Light from all the mirrors goes to one shady spot on the wall. QUESTIONS: 1. How could you make the spot brighter? 2. Will the spot feel hot? Make a prediction. (To predict means you say what you think is going to happen.) 3. How will you find out whether your prediction was correct? NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2742018/05/02 3:59:21 PM 275Chapter 19: Systems for looking into space275 4. The sun does not only give us light. It also gives us heat. You know that if you stand facing the sun with your eyes closed, you can still feel heat from the sun on your face. How could the class make the spot hotter? 5. Can you make it even hotter by passing all the sunlight through a lens, onto the wall? INSTRUCTIONS (Part 3): 1. Put a candle inside a glass jar and put on the lid. 2. Can you melt the candle by using your mirrors? 3. Can you melt chocolate by using your mirrors? All the mirrors work together like one big mirror, even though they are far apart. They all collect a little bit of energy from the sun and send it to the bright spot. The mirror of a telescope works like that. The light from some stars is very faint because the stars are very far away. But the big mirror collects all the faint light and focuses it to one lens. Then the telescope can gather (put together) enough light from the star to get a photograph of the star. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) The SKA is a different kind of telescope for looking at the stars. Stars send out energy in light but also in radio waves. The SKA will receive radio waves that our eyes cannot see. An array means a large number of the same items. For example, when the desks in your classroom are all lined up neatly, we can call that an array of desks. The SKA will have an array of several thousand dishes like those in the picture on page 276. When you add together the area of all the dishes, the total area will be the same as one square kilometre. A square kilometre is an area in the shape of a square and the sides are each 1 km long. The area of the square will be 1 km 2 . That is why the telescope is called the Square Kilometre Array. Did you know? Sound waves must have a medium like air or water to travel through, but electromagnetic waves can travel through empty space. Visit SKA video goo.gl/ERYT4 NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2752018/05/02 3:59:21 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control276 This is how the SKA will look once it has been built. (Credit: SKA Organisation) There was actually a contest between South Africa and Australia to see who would host the SKA. Both countries really wanted it and the bid and voting went on for nine years. Then in 2012, it was announced that it would rather be hosted in both countries, but the larger portion of the dishes are to be in South Africa and Africa. But why does SKA need so many dishes? Isn’t one enough? Good question Felicity! Let’s find out. The dishes in the picture above look like the satellite TV dishes that you see on some people’s houses. Those dishes collect the weak TV signal that comes from a satellite high up in space. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2762018/05/02 3:59:22 PM 277Chapter 19: Systems for looking into space277 In the SKA, each dish collects a little of the radio signals that come from the stars, and sends it to a computer. The computer puts together all the signals to make a new picture of that star. Scientists from many countries are working together to build the SKA in the Northern Cape. Most of the telescopes will be near the town of Carnarvon. Some of the dishes will be very far away from Carnarvon. Some dishes will be in Ghana, Zambia, Mozambique and Madagascar. They will also collect signals from stars and send them to the computer in Carnarvon. Some of the dishes will be far away from Carnavon, in other countries across Africa, as well as Australia and New Zealand. (Credit: SKA Project South Africa) ACTIVITY 19.2: Answering questions about the SKA INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Look at the pictures of SKA in the previous text about the SKA. 2. Answer these questions. QUESTIONS: 1. How is the picture of the SKA dishes like the picture of the class using mirrors to make a bright spot on the wall? Did you know? SKA will be the world’s biggest and most sensitive radio telescope in the world. It will be finished in the year 2024. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2772018/05/02 3:59:22 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control278 2. Why does the SKA need so many collecting dishes? 3. Why does it help the SKA to have dishes far away in Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique? 4. Where in South Africa will the SKA dishes be built? The SKA will be able to pick up signals that stars sent out thousands of millions of years ago. The signals have been travelling through space for all that time. When the SKA picks up those signals, we will learn something about that time when the universe began, thousands of millions of years ago! KEY CONCEPTS • The objects we see in the sky are very far away. • We can use telescopes to see them more clearly, and to measure how far away they are. • Lenses can focus light to make a clear image. • Mirrors help to collect more light when stars are very faint (not bright).

You learned about this planet in Chapter 16. They have found out what Mars is like by using vehicles called rovers that send back information to Earth. Let’s have a look at some of these different rovers and how they operate. The Pathfinder rover In 1997 the Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars. It had a small rover inside; the Pathfinder opened up and the rover came out and began taking photographs of Mars. Look at the photo on page 281. The photo is not very clear but remember that it was taken with a robot camera, which sent the picture by radio signals, back to Earth. The driver of the rover was millions of kilometres away on Earth and used radio signals to steer the rover. The Pathfinder rover used electric motors to move. The electricity for the motors came from photovoltaic (solar) panels on its rooftop. Solar panels transfer energy from sunlight to the electric motors. Find the solar panels in the photo. The solar panels that you learned about in Chapter 15 last term are also photovoltaic panels. New words • rover • photovoltaic • radio signal • micro-organisms Did you know? Photo means ‘light’ and voltaic means ‘electricity’. So photovoltaic means producing electricity using light. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2802018/05/02 3:59:22 PM 281Chapter 20: Systems to explore the moon and Mars281 This is the rover that was carried by the Pathfinder spacecraft. It has instruments to find out what the rock is made of. The rovers called Spirit and Opportunity These two rovers landed on Mars in 2004. Like Pathfinder, they also used solar panels that generate electricity from sunlight. In 2010, after six years, the rover called Spirit got stuck in sand. Soon after this it stopped sending back messages. The rover called Opportunity is still working, after 13 years on Mars! It has travelled over 44 km and sent back thousands of pictures. The Opportunity rover is going to scrape some grains off that rock and analyse it. Visit Opportunity’s mission (video) goo.gl/OW5Qm NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2812018/05/02 3:59:22 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control282 The rover called Curiosity This rover is the size of a small car and will be able to travel further and collect much more information about the surface of Mars. Scientists want to know whether there are any living things on other planets. So the rover will look for signs that micro-organisms lived on Mars a long time ago. Micro-organisms are very tiny organisms that cannot be seen by the eye. They are so small that millions would fit onto the tip of a needle. The Mars rover called Curiosity The rover has video cameras to show the driver back on Earth what is in front of the rover, and it has a long arm with a scoop to pick up soil samples. It also has a laser that can heat rock until it turns into vapour. Then special cameras look at the vapour and find out what substances are in the vapour. Can you see the cameras in the photo?

This was the first time, but for Apollo 15, 16 and 17 each mission had a lunar rover called a moon buggy. Lunar means ‘relating to the moon’. Look at the first photo of the lunar rover. This vehicle went to the moon in 1972 and it is still there. Another spacecraft photographed it in 2011. You will find out more about this rover when you investigate rovers for your Technology project.

You are now part of a crew in the Apollo scientific mission. We are approaching the moon! Investigate the need for a moon rover Your mission is to collect rocks from the moon. Scientists back on Earth want to study those rocks and find out whether they are the same as rocks on Earth. You have to collect from different places on the moon, so you need to be able to move around on the surface. In 1972, scientists really did go to the moon to collect rocks.

QUESTIONS Write one fact about the moon that you must think about when you design your rover. Write a sentence to explain why that fact is important. Investigate ways to move people and equipment The rover on the moon had four electric motors – one motor in each wheel. It did not need a steering wheel, because the driver could switch the motors on and off in each wheel. This steered the vehicle. It had two seats with seat-belts. Astronauts used this rover on the moon during the Apollo 17 mission. The part that looks like an umbrella is an aerial that picked up radio messages from Earth. Can you see this in the photo? It looks a bit like a satellite dish you see on some houses for television. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2872018/05/02 3:59:24 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control288 QUESTIONS 1. How do you think the rover got energy to work the motors in the wheels? 2. The rover was made of very light materials. Why did the rover have to be light? 3. Why did the wheels have shields over them? The shields are the orange things over the wheels. 4. The wheels of the rover were quite wide. What would happen if the wheels were narrow like a bicycle wheel? 5. Why must cars on Earth have headlights? 6. Do you think the rover needed headlights? Investigate ways to give energy to the rover Your moon rover needs energy to make it move. Do you remember that in Grade 5 we looked at energy and movement in Energy and Change? Hey, that was over a year ago when we did energy and movement! I don’t remember much so can we please refresh our memories? Of course Felicity! This is also quite a difficult topic and you will learn more about it in later grades, so let’s refresh some of these terms. When you stretch an elastic you give it energy, called stored energy. Another way of saying this is that you give the elastic potential energy. This means it has the potential to do work. Or in other words, in the future the stretched elastic band can do something. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2882018/05/02 3:59:24 PM 289Chapter 20: Systems to explore the moon and Mars289 This stretched elastic band has potential (stored) energy. When you let the stretched elastic band go, it now moves as it springs back. This is movement energy, which is also called kinetic energy. Kinetic means movement. The potential energy stored in the stretched elastic band changed into kinetic energy as the elastic band was released and moved. Now let’s apply these terms to the rover. You can also give something potential energy by lifting it up off the ground, as it then has the potential to fall or move back to the ground. You can give energy to your moon rover if you lift it up on a plank, as you see in this picture. No potential energy, no kinetic energy. Now it has potential energy. One way to give your rover energy to move. When you lift up the plank and rover, your hand gives some of your energy to the rover. It now has potential energy to move. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2892018/05/02 3:59:25 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control290 QUESTIONS When you let the rover go, what will happen? Use the words ‘kinetic energy’ in your answer. The plank is useful for testing the wheels of your model. But the rover must be able to go up hills, not only down them. The second way to give your rover energy to move is to use an electric motor and battery. Do you remember last term when we looked at electric circuits? The source of energy for a circuit is a cell or battery. You can fit an electric motor and a battery to your rover. The potential energy in that system is in the battery. A battery is a source of potential energy for an electric motor. 1 Another way to make your rover move on the moon is to use a rocket. Rockets will work on the moon. Inside the rocket, gas pushes against all the sides. Some gas pushes against the walls of the balloon, and some gas pushes out through the opening of the balloon. Look at the rocket car in the picture. The gas pushing through the opening of the balloon pushes the whole car forward. The balloon works like a rocket. You have to give it potential energy first. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2902018/05/02 3:59:25 PM 291Chapter 20: Systems to explore the moon and Mars291 This rocket is on rollers. Could you fit wheels to this car? The real moon rovers had batteries and electric motors in each wheel. Many electric cars have a motor. This motor can give energy to your moon rover. Investigate ways to make a body with wheels Your moon rover needs a body for the scientists to sit on and to put the rocks into. The body of a vehicle must have good ways to hold the wheels. We looked at wheels and axles in Grade 5 in Energy and Change. A wheel fits onto an axle, which is a solid rod or bar that allows the wheels to turn. QUESTIONS Draw and label the two wheels and the axle on the diagram: You know there are different ways to let wheels turn on an axle. One way is to have the axle fixed to the body, and the wheels are free to turn on the axle. What is the other way to let wheels turn? Wheels fixed to the axle You can use plastic straws or the barrel of a ballpoint pen to make a bearing for an axle. The following picture shows two ways to fix the bearings onto the body. The bearing is the hollow tube that the axle goes through. The bearing must be bigger than the axle so that the axle can turn easily.

What are some materials that you could use to make the axle in the above picture? You can also use plastic signboard or strong corrugated cardboard to make a body with wheels. Can you see how the axle goes through the holes in the cardboard? Corrugated cardboard or plastic advertising board Dowel stick or stiff wire The board makes bearings for the axles, which are fixed to the wheels. The axles turn in the holes.

This time the axle remains still and the wheels turn on the axle. The axle is fastened to the wooden body with cable clips. Cable clips fasten telephone cables to walls. Can you see the blown up version of a cable clip? The clips must hold the axle tightly, so that the wheels are free to rotate. How the cable clips can hold an axle. A clip to hold telephone cables to the wall. Now that we are finished investigating, let’s start designing!

One of the astronauts driving a moon rover. The Apollo engineers designed other rovers, but in the end they chose this design. Your design will look different to their designs. ACTIVITY 20.2: Designing and making your rover SPECIFICATIONS: 1. Your rover must be balloon powered. 2. Your rover’s wheels should be able to roll easily and it should go at least 2 m on the floor. 3. Your rover must have two seats and it must have a model of you as a moon explorer. 4. It must be able to carry two small stones for at least 2 m. The stones represent rock samples from the moon, to take back to Earth. CONSTRAINTS: You must build your rover in class. DESIGN: 1. Draw a picture of a rover you could make in your exercise books. 2. Show the seats, with an astronaut in one seat. Show the place where the moon rocks will go. Did you know? An engineer is someone who designs and builds machines and structures for a living. If you enjoy the Technology projects then maybe one day you could be an engineer! NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2942018/05/02 3:59:27 PM 295Chapter 20: Systems to explore the moon and Mars295 3. Add other parts that your rover should have. Write labels to tell everyone what the different parts of the rover are. 4. Leave some space for a second design. When you begin making the rover, you will get better ideas. Then you can draw another picture of your final design. The two pictures will show how your ideas changed. MATERIALS: Things to collect for wheels: You can collect snuffboxes, shoe-polish tins or the lids of bottles. You can also cut out cardboard circles. Things to collect for axles: You can find sosatie sticks, stiff plastic straws, wooden dowel sticks, aluminium rods. The school may have plastic rods from a supplier. You can also use nails or wire to make axles. Cardboard circles Snuff boxes Lids of jars Plastic rods Plastic straws Bottle-tops Nails Wooden dowels Things you can use for wheels and axles Tools and materials you need as a class: • Long-nose pliers to cut and bend wire • Hole-makers (small and big nails) and big scissors for cutting cardboard NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2952018/05/02 3:59:28 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control296 • Small hammer to drive the nails • Glue (make flour glue in class) • Balloons to power the rover • Crayons or paint (to decorate your rover car) Remember to also colour the scientist who drives the rover. MAKE: Now let’s make the rover. Below are some tips that will help you when making your rover. Remember that you may not have the perfect design from the start! So when making your rover, you need to go back and modify your design as you find things which work and do not work. 1. How to find the centre of a wheel – a wheel is a circle: • Some plastic lids have a small dimple or lump that shows you where the centre is. • If your lids or discs do not have a dimple, you can use a ruler to draw diameter lines across the middle. • A diameter line is the longest line you can draw across a circle. Where diameters cross, that is the centre. Draw three diameters and mark the centre. In this example the centre is the red dot. 2. How to make the right size hole in the centre: • If you want the wheel to rotate on the axle, then you must make a hole that is a little bit bigger than the diameter of the axle. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2962018/05/02 3:59:28 PM 297Chapter 20: Systems to explore the moon and Mars297 • If you want the wheel to be tight on the axle, then you must make a hole that is smaller than the diameter of the axle. When you push the wheel onto the axle, it will grip the axle. 3. How to stop wheels wobbling on their axles: • If the axle goes through just one surface of the lid, this is what can happen: the wheel will wobble. You need to give the lid another surface. Glue two lids together. • Or else, trace the shape of the lid on cardboard, mark a hole in the centre of the circle, and cut out the cardboard. Cut the cardboard so that the disc will be a tight fit in the lid. Then glue the cardboard into the lid. One lid wobbles Two lids don’t wobble Glue the edges together You can stop the wobbling by glueing two lids together. 4. Does the wheel rub against the body of the rover? • You need a spacer on the axle, to keep some space between the wheel and the body. • You can use a bead with a large hole, or you can make plastic washers from slippery plastic. Milk bottles are good for making slippery washers. • Use an office punch for making neat holes in a piece of milk-bottle plastic. Then cut around the holes to make washers. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2972018/05/02 3:59:28 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control298 This is a spacer Where to use a spacer or washer. 5. Does the wheel come off the axle? • Push a piece of soft tubing onto the end of the axle as you see in the picture below. • Or push on a flat piece of cardboard and hold it on the axle with glue. Glue Card or plastic Soft tubing Soft plastic tubing or glue will stop the wheel coming off the axle. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2982018/05/02 3:59:28 PM 299Chapter 20: Systems to explore the moon and Mars299 6. Does the rover not run in a straight line? • The axles must be parallel in your rover. • These axles in the picture below are not parallel. If your axles go through the body, then the axle holes must be the same distance apart on the left and the right side. • If you need to make a hole in a new place, then you can glue a small piece of card with a hole in it over the old hole. These axles are not parallel so the rover will not go straight. Test your rover and make it run as well as you can. Go back and draw your improved design. Draw the rover you have made and write labels to explain what all the parts do. For example, you can write: “This piece of straw stops the wheel rubbing against the body.” EVALUATE: At this point in a Technology project, you stop and ask yourself, did we do a good project? Did we make something that solves the problem? Clear an area in the classroom to show the moon rovers. Show your moon rover and how it moves by itself, or how it rolls down a sloping plank. NatSci&Tech_Gr6_Book.indb 2992018/05/02 3:59:29 PM Planet Earth and beyond and systems and control300 Discuss these questions in the class for each moon rover: 1. What were the specifications for the moon rover? 2. Does the rover have a model of the astronaut sitting on it? 3. Can your rover carry small moon rocks back to your moon lander? 4. Does your rover have a hinge anywhere in it? 5. Do the wheels roll easily? 6. Can your moon rover go at least 2 m? 7. Whose rover rolls the furthest? 8. Does it roll in a straight line, or does it roll in a curve? 9. Did you need to make the body of the rover stronger? What did you do to make it stronger? 10. If you really had to go to the moon, what would you need on a real rover car? 11. Write down how far each moon rover can go after it rolls down the plank. You now need to draw a bar graph to present this data (information) in your exercise books. Your teacher will help you to get started and then you can finish drawing it yourself. After you have tested and evaluated everyone’s rovers as a class, write an evaluation of your own rover. Remember to answer the questions above when evaluating how successful your rover is. Below is a summary of some of the things that we learned from doing this project: • Axles must be parallel for the vehicle to run straight. • Axles can be fixed and wheels free to turn, or the axle can turn with the wheels fixed to it. • Axles turn in bearings. Bearings let axles turn freely. • A car must have energy from some source. The source can be a hand that lifts the car up to the top of a ramp, or the source can be a falling weight, or the source can be rubber bands or a blown-up balloon.

In the arrangement below, the blue dots are in groups likethis: The red dots are in groups like this: (a) How would you go about finding the number of blue dots below, if you do not want to count them one by one? (b) Implement your plan, to find out how many blue dots there are. Suppose you want to know how many black dots there are in the arrangement on page 3. One way is to count in groups of three. When you do this, you may have to point with your finger or pencil to keep track. The counting will go like this: three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen . . . Another way to find out how many black dots there are is to analyse the arrangement and do some calculations. In the arrangement, there are ten rows of threes from the top to the bottom, and three columns of threes from left to right, just as in the table alongside. One way to calculate the total number of black dots is to do 3 × 10 = 30 for the dots in each column, and then 30 + 30 + 30 = 90. Another way is to add up each row (3 + 3 + 3 = 9) and then multiply by 10: 10 × 9 = 90. A third way is to notice that there are 3 × 10 = 30 groups of three, so the total is 3 × 30 = 90. 2. When you determined the number of blue dots in question 1(b), did you count in fives, or did you analyse and calculate, or did you use some other method? Now use a different method to determine the number of blue dots and check whether you get the same answer as before. Describe the method that you used. 3. The numbers that you get when you count in fives are called multiples of five. Copy the table below and draw circles around all the multiples of 5. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 4.

(b) Count in 300s to find the total value of all the R100 notes in all the tins. 14. (a) How much money is there in total in the eight yellow tins in question 13? (b) Join with two classmates and tell them how you worked to find the total amount of money. 15.(a) Investigate what is easiest for you, to count in twenties or in thirties or in fifties, up to 500. (b) Many people find it easier to count in fifties than in thirties. Why do you think this is so? 16. What do you expect to be the most difficult, to count in forties or in seventies or in nineties? Investigate this and write a short report. Here is some advice that can make it easier to count in certain counting units, for example in seventies. It feels easier to count in fifties than in seventies because you get to multiples of 100 at every second step: fifty, hundred, one hundred and fifty, two hundred, two hundred and fifty, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 ... and so on. When you count in seventies, this does not happen: seventy, one hundred and forty, two hundred and ten, two hundred and eighty ... 9 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS It may help you to cross over the multiples of 100 in two steps each time, like this: 70 + 30 → 100 + 40 → 140 + 60 → 200 + 10 → 210 + 70 → 280 ... 30 + 40 = 70 60 + 10 =70 In this way, you make the multiples of 100 act as “stepping stones” for your counting. 17. (a) Count in forties up to 1 000. Try to use multiples of 100 as stepping stones. You can write the numbers while youcount. (b) Write down the first twenty multiples of 80. (c) Write down the first twenty multiples of 90. (d) Write down the first ten multiples of700. 18. Copy and complete this table. × 60 50 70 90 40 20 30 80 8 6 7 9 5 3 4 2 70 30 60 80 40 90 50 20 doubling and halving 1. Write the next eight numbers in each pattern: (a) 1 2 4 8 16 32 (b) 3 6 12 24 (d) 5 10 15 20 2. Which pattern or patterns in question 1 are not formed by repeated doubling? 10 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 (c) 5 10 20 40 (e) 6 12 24 48 The pattern 3 6 12 24 48 ... may be called the repeated doubling pattern that starts with 3. 3. Copy the table. Write the first nine terms of the repeated doubling patterns that start with the numbers in the left column of the table. The pattern for 13 has been completed as an example. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 26 52 104 208 416 832 1 664 3 328 14 15 16 17 18 19 Doubling can be used to do multiplication. For example, 29 × 8 can be calculated as follows: 8 doubled is 16, so 16 = 2 × 8 (step1) 16 doubled is 32, so 32 = 4 × 8 (step2) 32 doubled is 64, so 64 = 8 × 8 (step3) 64 doubled is 128, so 128 = 16 × 8 (step 4). Doubling again will go past 29 × 8. 16 × 8 + 8 × 8 + 4 × 8 = (16 + 8 + 4) × 8 = 28 × 8. So 28 × 8 = 128 + 64 + 32 which is 224. So 29 × 8 = 224 + 8 = 232. 4. Work as in the above example to calculate each of the following. Write only what you need to write. (a) 37× 21 (b) 17 × 41 11 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS 5. Continue each repeated halving pattern as far as you can: (a) 1 024 512 256 128 (b) 64 000 32 000 16 000 8 000 Halving can also be used to do multiplication. For example, 37× 28 can be calculated as follows: 100 × 28 = 2 800. Half of that is 50 × 28, which is half of 2 800, that is 1 400. Half of 50 × 28 is half of 1 400, so 25 × 28 is 700. 10 × 28 = 280, so 25 × 28 + 10 × 28 = 980, so 35 × 28 = 980. 2 × 28 = 2 × 25 + 2 × 3 = 56, so 37 × 28 is 980 + 56 = 1 036. 6. 80 × 78 = 6 240. Use this information to work out each of the following: (a) 20× 78 (b) 37 × 78 If chickens cost R27 each, how many chickens can you buy with R2 400? A way to use halving to work this out is shown below. 100 chickens cost 100 × 27 = R2 700. That is more than R2 400. Fifty chickens cost half as much, that is R1 350. So I can buy 50 chickens and even more. Half of 50 is 25, and half of R1 350 is R675. So 75 chickens cost R1 350 + R675,which is R2 025. So there is R375 left. Tenchickens cost R270, so 85 chickens cost R2 025 + R270 = R2 295. There is R105 left. Three chickens cost 3 × R25 + 3 × R2 = R81. I can buy 88 chickens and that will cost R2 376. 7. Use halving as in the above example to work out how many books at R67 each a school can buy with R5 000. Copy and use table on left to show your calculations. using multiplication to do division 1. R7 500 must be shared between 27 netball players. The money is in R10 notes, and no small change is available.

(c) Do you think there is enough money to give each player R300? (d) How much of the R7 500 will be left over, if each player is given R200? (e) Is there enough money left to give each player R50 more, in other words a total of R250 each? (f) What is the highest amount that can be given to each player, so that lessthan R270 is left over? Remember that you cannot split up the R10 notes. 2. Work like you did in question 1 to solve this problem: There is 4 580 m of string on a big roll. How many pieces of 17 m each can be cut from this roll? Hint: You may start by asking yourself how much string will be used if you cut off 100 pieces of 17 m each. 3. Work like you did in questions 1 and 2 to solve this problem: A shop owner has R1 800 available with which he can buy chickens from a farmer. The farmer wants R26 foreach chicken. How many chickens can the shop owner buy? What you actually did in questions 1, 2 and 3 was to calculate 7 500 ÷ 27,4 580 ÷ 17 and 1 800 ÷ 26. You solved division problems. Yet most of the work was to do multiplication, and a little bit of subtraction. When you had to calculate 1 800 ÷ 26 in question 3, you may have asked yourself: With what must I multiply 26, to get as close to 1 800 as possible? Division is called the inverse of multiplication. Multiplication is called the inverse of division. Multiplication and division are inverse operations. 1.2 Ordering and comparing whole numbers how far can you count, and how far is far? 1. How long will it take to count to a million? Let us say it takes one second to count each number. Find out how long is one million seconds. Work in your exercise book. Give your final answer in days, hours and seconds. 2. Write 234 500 320 in words. 3. In each case write one of the symbols > or < to indicate which number is the smaller of the two.

These distances are given in millions of kilometres. One million kilometres is 1 000 000 km.

Which planet is the second farthest planet from the sun? 6. How does Mars’ distance from the sun compare to that of Venus? Give two possible answers. 7. Arrange the planets from the smallest to the biggest. Sometimes we do not need to know the exact number or exact amount. We say a loaf of bread costs about R10, or a bag of mealie meal costs about R20. The loaf of bread may cost R8 or R12 but it is close to R10. The mealie meal may cost R18 or R21 but it is close to R20. When you read in a newspaper that there were 15000 spectators at a soccer game, you know that that is not the actual number. In the language of mathematics we call this process rounding off or rounding. 14 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 The distances from the sun are called average distances, because the planets are not always the same distance from the sun. Their orbits are not circles. rounding to 5s, 10s, 100s and 1 000s To round off to the nearest 5, we round numbers that end in 1 or 2, or 6 or 7 down to the closest multiple of 5. We round numbers that end in 3 or 4, or 8 or 9 up to the closest multiple of 5. For example, 233 is rounded down to 230, 234 is rounded up to 235, 237 is rounded down to 235 and 238 is rounded up to 240. 1. Round the following numbers to the nearest 5 by checking the unit value: (a) 612 (b) 87 (c) 454 (d) 1 328 To round off to the nearest 10, we round numbers that end in 1, 2, 3 or 4 down to the closest multiple of 10 (or decade). We round numbers that end in 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 up to the closest multiple of 10. For example, if you want to round off 534 to the nearest 10, you have to look at the units digit. The units digit is 4 and it is closer to 0 than to 10. The rounded off number will be 530. 2. Round the following numbers to the nearest 10 by checking the unit value: (a) 12 (b) 87 (c) 454 (d) 1 325 When rounding to the nearest 100, we look at the last two digits of the number. If the number is less than 50 we round down to the lower 100. If the number is 50 or more we round up to the higher 100. 3. Copy and complete the table.

Is the hundreds value less than, equal to or greater than 500? If less than 500, round down (the thousands value stays the same), if equal to 500 round up, and if greater than 500 round up too. When rounding to the nearest 10 000, we look at the thousands. Is the thousands value less than, equalto or greater than 5 000? If less than 5 000, round down (the ten thousands value stays the same), if equal to 5 000 or greater than 5 000 round up. 4. Copy and then complete the table.

The number 80 can also be produced by multiplying 5 and 16: 5 × 16 = 80. 1. In what other ways can 80 be produced by multiplying two numbers? The number 80 can also be produced by multiplying 2, 10 and 4: 2 × 10 = 20 and 20 × 4 = 80 or 10 × 4 = 40 and 40 × 2 = 80. We can use brackets to describe what calculation is done first. So instead of writing “2 × 10 = 20 and 20 × 4 = 80”, we may write (2 × 10) × 4. Instead of writing “10 × 4 = 40 and 40 × 2”, we may write 2 × (10 × 4). 2. Show how the number 80 can be produced by multiplying four numbers. Describe how you do it in two ways: without using brackets and by using brackets. 3. Show three different ways in which the number 30 can be produced by multiplying two numbers. 4. (a) Can the number 30 be produced by multiplying three whole numbers? Which three whole numbers? 16 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 (b) Can the number 30 be produced by multiplying four whole numbers that do not include the number 1? If you answered “yes”, which four numbers? The number 105 can be produced by multiplying 3, 5 and 7, hence we can write 105 = 3 × 5 × 7. Mathematicians often describe this by saying “105 is the product of 3, 5 and 7” or “105 can be expressed as the product 3 × 5 × 7”. 5. Express each of the following numbers as a product of three numbers. (a) 248 (b) 375 The whole numbers that are multiplied to form a number are called factors of the number. For example, 6 and 8 are factors of 48 because 6 × 8 = 48. But 6 and 8 are not the only numbers that are factors of 48. 2 is also a factor of 48 because 48 = 2 × 24. And 24 is a factor of 48. The numbers 3 and 16 are also factors of 48 because 48 = 3 × 16. 6. Describe all the different ways in which 48 can be expressed as a product of two factors. The number 36 can be formed by 2 × 2 × 3 × 3. Because 2 is used twice, it is called a repeated factor of 36. The number 3 is also a repeated factor of 36. 7. (a) Express 48 as a product of three factors. (b) Express 75 as a product of three factors. 8. (a) Can 36 be expressed as a product of three factors? How? (b) Can 36 be expressed as a product of five factors? How? 9. Express each of the following numbers as a product of as many factors as possible, including repeated factors. Do not use 1 as a factor.

Which of the numbers in question 1 cannot be expressed as a product of two whole numbers, except as the product 1 × the number itself? A number that cannot be expressed as a product of two whole numbers, except as the product 1 × the number itself, is called a prime number. 3. (a) Which of the numbers in question 1 are prime numbers? (b) Which numbers between 20 and 30 are prime numbers? (c) Are 11and 17 prime numbers? Eratosthenes, a Greek mathematician who lived a long time ago, designed a method to find the prime numbers. The process is called “the sieve of Eratosthenes”. 4. Copy the table on the right. Follow the steps to find all the prime numbers up to 100. Step 1: Cross out 1. Step 2: Circle 2, and then cross out all the multiples of 2. Step 3: Circle 3, then cross out all the multiples of 3. Step 4: Find the next number that has not been crossed out and cross out all its multiples. Continue like this. 5. (a) What is the smallest number that can be formed as a product of three prime numbers, if the same factor may be repeated? (b) What is the smallest number that can be formed as a product of three prime numbers, if no repeated factors are allowed? 6. Manare did a lot of work, and found out that 840 can be formed as the product of 2, 2, 2, 3, 5 and 7. Check whether Manare is correct. We can say that Manare found the prime factors of 840, or Manare factorised 840 completely. We can write: 2 × 2 → 4 × 2 → 8 × 3 → 24 × 5 → 120 × 7 = 840. 18 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 7. The prime factors of some numbers are given below. What are the numbers? (a) 3, 5, 5 and 11 (b) 3, 3, 5 and 7 (c) 2, 7, 11and13 8. Investigate which of the following statements you agree with. Give reasons for your agreement or disagreement in each case. (a) If a number is even, 2 is one of its prime factors. (b) If half an even number is also even, 2 is a repeated prime factor. (c) If a number is odd, 3 is one of its prime factors. (d) If a number ends in 0 or 5, then 5 is one of its prime factors. Here is a method to find the prime factors of a number: If the number is even, divide it by 2. If the answer is even, divide by 2 again. Continue like this as long as it is possible. If the answer is odd, divide by 3, if it is possible. Continue to divide by 3 as long as it is possible. Then switch to 5. Continue like this by each time trying to divide by the next prime number. 9. Find all the prime factors of each of the following numbers. Write only your answers below. (a) 588 (b) 825 (c) 729 (d) 999 (e) 538 (f) 113 10. Find at least three prime numbers between 800 and 850. highest common factor and lowest common multiple 1. (a) Factorise 195 and 385 completely. (b) Is 7 a factor of both 195 and 385? (c) Is 5 a factor of both 195 and 385? When a number is a factor of two or more other numbers, it is called a common factor of the other numbers. For example, the number 5 is a common factor of 195 and 385. The factors of a certain number are 2; 2; 5; 7; 7; 11 and 17. The factors of another number are 2; 3; 3; 7; 7; 11; 13 and 23. The common prime factors of these two numbers are 2; 7; 7 and 11. The biggest number that is a factor of two or more numbers is called the highest common factor (HCF) of the numbers. 19 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS 2. Find the HCF of the two numbers in each of the following cases. (a) 2 × 2 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 11× 17 and 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7 × 11× 13 × 23 (b) 24 and 40 (c) 8 and12 (d) 12 and 20 (e) 210 and 56 3. Write five different numbers, all different from 35, that have 35 as a highest common factor. 4. Copy pattern A and pattern B. Write the next seven numbers in each pattern: A: 12 24 36 48 B: 15 30 45 60 The numbers in pattern A are called the multiples of 12. The numbers in pattern B are called the multiples of 15. The numbers, for example 60 and 120, that occur in both patterns, are called the common multiples of 12 and 15. The smallest of these numbers, namely 60, is called the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15. 5. Continue writing multiples of 18 and 24 until you find the LCM: 18 36 24 48 6. Find the HCF and LCM of the given numbers in each case below: (a) 5 and 7 (b) 15 and 14 (c) 20and 30 (d) 10 and 100 (e) 8 and 9 (f) 25 and 24 (g) 8 and 12 (h) 10 and 18 1.4 Properties of operations order of operations and the associative property Suppose you want to tell another person to do some calculations. You may do this by writing instructions. For example, you may write the instruction 200 − 130 − 30. This may be called a numerical expression. Suppose you have given the instruction 200 − 130 − 30 to two people, whom we will call Ben and Sara. This is what Ben does: 200 − 130 = 70 and 70 − 30 = 40. This is what Sara does: 130 − 30 = 100 and 200 − 100 = 100. To prevent such different interpretations or understandings of the same numerical expression, mathematicians have made the following agreement, and this is followed all over the world: 20 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 In a numerical expression that involves addition and subtraction only, the operations should be performed from left to right, unless otherwise indicated in some way. 1. Who followed this convention, Ben or Sara? 2. Follow the above convention and calculate each of the following: (a) 8 000 + 6 000 − 3 000 (b) 8 000 − 3 000 + 6 000 (c) 8 000 + 3 000 − 6 000 3. Follow the above convention and calculate each of the following: (a) R25 000 + R30 000 + R13 000 + R6 000 (b) R13 000 + R6 000 + R30 000 + R25 000 (c) R30 000 + R25 000 + R6 000 + R13 000 In question 3, all your answers should be the same. When three or more numbers are added, the order in which you perform the calculations makes no difference. This is called the associative property of addition. We also say that: addition is associative. 4. Investigate whether multiplication is associative. Use the numbers 2, 3, 5 and 10. 5. What must be added to each of the following numbers to get 100? 73 56 66 41 34 23 88 6. Calculate each of the following. Note that you can make the work simple by being smart in deciding which additions to do first. (a) 73 + 54 + 27 + 46 + 138 (b) 34 + 88 + 41 + 66 + 59 + 12 + 127 the commutative property of addition and multiplication 1. (a) What is the total cost of 20 chairs at R250 each? (b) What is the total cost of 250 exercise books at R20 each? (c) R5 000 was paid for 100 towels. What is the price for one towel? (d) R100 was paid for 5 000 beads. What is the price for one bead? 2. Which of the following calculations will produce the same answer? Copy the calculations and mark those that will produce the same answers with a ✓ and those that won’t with a ✗. (a) 20 × 250 and 250 × 20 (b) 5 000 ÷ 100 and 100 ÷ 5000 (c) 730 + 270 and 270+ 730 (d) 730 − 270 and 270 −730 21 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS An agreement like this is called a mathematical convention. 25 + 75 and 75 + 25 have the same answer. The same is true for any other two numbers. We say: addition is commutative; the numbers can be swopped around. 3. Demonstrate each of your answers with two different examples. (a) Is subtraction commutative? (b) Is multiplication commutative? (c) Is division commutative? more conventions and the distributive property 1. Do the following: (a) Multiply 5 by 3, then add the answer to 20. (b) Add 5 to 20, then multiply the answer by 5. Mathematicians have agreed that unlessotherwise indicated, multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. According to this convention, the expression 20 + 5 × 3 should be taken to mean “multiply 5 by 3, then add the answer to 20” and not “add 5 to 20, then multiply the answer by 3”. 2. Follow the above convention and calculate each of the following: (a) 500 + 20 × 10 (b) 500 − 20× 10 (c) 500 + 20 − 10 (d) 500 − 20+ 10 (e) 500 + 200 ÷ 5 (f) 500 − 200 ÷ 5 If some of your answers are the same, you have made mistakes. The above convention creates a problem. How can one describe the calculations in question 1(b) with a numerical expression, without using words? To solve this problem, mathematicians have agreed to use brackets in numerical expressions. Brackets are used to specify that the operations within the brackets should be done first. Hence the numerical expression for 1(b) above is (20 + 5) × 5, and the answer is 125. If there are no brackets in a numerical expression,itmeans that multiplication and division should be done first, and addition and subtraction onlylater. If you wish to specify that addition or subtraction should be done first, that part of the expression should be enclosed in brackets. 22 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 examples The expression 12 + 3 × 5 means “multiply 3 by 5, then add 12”. It does not mean “add 12 and 3, then multiply by 5”. If you wish to say “add 5 and 12, then multiply by 3”, the numerical expression should be 3 × (5 + 12) or (5 + 12) × 3. They mean the same. 3. Keep the various mathematical conventions about numerical expressions in mind when you calculate each of the following: (a) 500 + 30 × 10 (b) (500 + 30) × 10 (c) 100 × 500 + 30 (d) 100 × (500 + 30) (e) 500 − 30 × 10 (f) (500 − 30) × 10 (g) 100 × 500 − 30 (h) 100 × (500 −30) (i) (200 + 300) ÷ 20 (j) 200 ÷ 20 + 300 ÷ 20 (k) 600 ÷ (20 + 30) (l) 600 ÷ 20 + 600 ÷ 30 4. Calculate the following: (a) 50 × (70+ 30) (b) 50 × 70 + 50 × 30 (c) 50 × (70 − 30) (d) 50 × 70 − 50 × 30 Your answers for 4(a) and 4(b) should be the same. Your answers for 4(c) and 4(d) should also be the same. 5. Do not do calculations A to I below. Just answer these questions about them. You will check your answers later. (a) Will A and B have the same answers? (b) Will G and H have the same answers? (c) Will A and D have the same answers? (d) Will A and G have the same answers? (e) Will A and F have the same answers? (f) Will D and E have the same answers? A: 5 × (200 + 3) B: 5 × 200 + 3 C: 5 × 200 + 5 × 3 D: 5 + 200 × 3 E: (5 + 200) × 3 F: (200 + 3) × 5 G: 5 × 203 H: 5 × 100 + 5 × 103 I: 5 × 300 − 5 × 70 6. Now do calculations A to I. Then check the answers you gave in question 5. 7. (a) Choose three different numbers between 3 and 11,and write them down like this: Your first number: Your second number: Your third number: (b) Add your first number to your third number. Multiply the answer by your second number. (c) Multiply your first number by your second number. Also multiply your third number by your second number. Add the two answers. (d) If you worked correctly, you should get the same answers in (b) and (c). Do you think you will get the same result with numbers between 10 and 100, or any other numbers? 23 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS The fact that your answers for calculations like those in 7(b) and 7(c) are equal, for any numbers that you may choose, is called the distributive property of multiplication over addition. It may be described as follows: first number × second number + first number × third number = first number × (second number + third number). This can be described by saying that multiplication distributes over addition. 8. Check whether the distributive property is true for the following sets of numbers: (a) 100, 50 and 10 (b) any three numbers of your own choice (you may use a calculator to do this) 9. Use the numbers in question 8(a) to investigate whether multiplication also distributes over subtraction. It is quite fortunate that multiplication distributes over addition, because it makes it easier to multiply. For example, 8 × 238 can be calculated by calculating 8 × 200, 8 × 30 and 8 × 8, and adding the answers: 8 × 238 = 8 × 200 + 8 × 30 + 8 × 8 = 1 600 + 240 + 64 = 1 904. 10. Check whether 8 × 238 is actually 1 904 by calculating 238 + 238 + 238 + 238 + 238 + 238 + 238 + 238, or by using a calculator. 1.5 Basic operations a method of addition To add two numbers, the one may be written below the other. For example, to calculate 378 539 + 46 285 the one number may be written below the other so that the units are below the units, the tens below the tens, and so on. Writing the numbers like this has the advantage that: • the units parts (9 and 5) of the two numbers are now in the same column, • the tens parts (30 and 80) are in the same column, • the hundreds parts (500 and 200) are in the same column, and so on. This makes it possible to work with each kind of part separately. 378 539 46 285 We only write this: In your mind you can see this: 378 539 300 000 70 000 8 000 500 30 9 46 285 40 000 6 000 200 80 5 24 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 The numbers in each column can be added to get a new set of numbers: 378 539 300 000 70 000 8 000 500 30 9 46 285 40 000 6 000 200 80 5 14 14 110 110 700 700 14 000 14 000 110 000 110 000 300 000 300 000 424 824 It is easy to add the new set of numbers to get the answer. Note that you can do the above steps in any order. Instead of starting with the units parts as shown above, you can start with the hundred thousands, or any other parts. Starting with the units parts has an advantage though as it makes it possible to do more of the work mentally and to write less, as shown below: 378 539 To achieve this, only the units digit 4 of the 14 is written in 46 285 the first step. The 10 of the 14 is remembered and added to 424 824 the 30 and 80 of the tens column, to get 120. We say the 10 is carried from the units column to the tens column. The same is done when the tens parts are added to get 120: only the digit “2” is written (in the tens column, so it means 20), and the 100 is carried to the next step. 1. Calculate each of the following: (a) 237 847 +87 776 (b) 567 298 + 392 076 (c) 28 387 + 365 667 A municipal manager is working on the municipal budget for a year. He has to try to keep the total expenditure on new office equipment below R800 000. He still has to budget for new computers that are badly needed, but this is what he has written so far: 74 new office chairs R 54 020 42 new computer screens R 100800 12 new printers R 141 600 18 new tea trolleys R 25 740 8 new carpets for senior staff offices R 144000 108 small plastic filing cabinets R 52 380 new table for the boardroom R 48 000 18 new chairs for the boardroom R 41 400 R 25 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS 2. How much has the municipal manager budgeted for printers and computer screens together? 3. How much, in total, has the municipal manager budgeted for chairs and tables? 4. Work out the total cost of all the items the municipal manager has budgeted for. 5. Calculate. (a) 23 809 + 2 009+ 23 (b) 320 293 + 16 923 + 349 + 200 323 methods of subtraction There are many ways to subtract one number from another. For example, R835 234 − R687 885 can be calculated by “filling up” from R687 885 to R835 234: 687 885 + 15 → 687 900 + 100 → 688 000 + 12 000 → 700 000 + 135 234 → 835 234 The difference between R687 885 and R835 234 can now be calculated by adding up the numbers that had to be added to 687 885 to get 835 234. So R835 234 − R687 885 = R147 349. 15 100 12 000 135 234 147 349 Another easy way to subtract is to round off and compensate. For example, to calculate R3 224 − R1 885, the R1 885 may be rounded up to R2 000. The calculation can proceed as follows: • Rounding R1 885 up to R2 000 can be done in two steps: 1 885 + 15 = 1 900, and 1 900 + 100 = 2 000. In total, 115 was added. • 115can now be added to 3 224 too: 3 224 + 115= 3 339. Instead of calculating R3 224 − R1 885, which is a bit difficult, R3 339 − R2 000 may be calculated. This is easy: R3 339 − R2 000 = R1 339. This means that R3 224 − R1 885 = R1 339, because R3 224 − R1 885 = (R3 224 + R115) − (R1 885 + R115). To do question 1, you may use any one of the above two methods, or any other method you may know and prefer. Do not use a calculator, because the purpose of this work is for you to come to understand how subtraction may be done. What you will learn here, will later help you to understand algebra. 1. Calculate each of the following: (a) 6 234 − 2 992 (b) 76 214 − 34 867 (c) 134 372 − 45 828 (d) 623 341 − 236 768 2. Check each of your answers in question 1 by doing addition, or by doing subtraction with a different method than the method you have already used. 26 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 Another method of subtraction is to think of the numbers in expanded notation. For example, to calculate R835 234 − R687 885, which was already done in a different way on the previous page, we could work like this: We may write this: In your mind you can see this: 835 234 800 000 30 000 5 000 200 30 4 687 885 600 000 80 000 7 000 800 80 5 Unfortunately, it is not possible to subtract in the columns now. However, the parts of the bigger number can be rearranged to make the subtraction in each column possible: 835 234 700 000 120 000 14 000 1100 120 14 687 885 600 000 80 000 7 000 800 80 5 100 000 40 000 7 000 300 40 9 The answer is now clearly visible; it is 147 349. The rearrangement, also called “borrowing”, was done like this: 10 was taken from the 30 in the tens column, and added to the 4 in the units column. 100 was taken from the 200 in the hundreds column, and added to the 20 that remained in the tens column. 1 000 was taken from the 5 000 in the thousands column, and added to the 100 that remained in the hundreds column. 3. Describe the other rearrangements that were made in the above work. It is not practical to write the expanded notation and the rearrangements each time you do a subtraction. However, with some practice you can learn to do it all in your mind without writing it down. Some people make small marks above the digits of the bigger number, or even change the digits, to keep track of the rearrangements they make in their minds. 4. Calculate the difference between the two car prices in each case. (a) R73 463 and R88 798 (b) R63 378 and R96889 5. In each case, first estimate the answer to the nearest 100 000, then calculate. (a) 238 769 −141 453 (b) 856 333 − 439 878 6. In each case, first estimate the answer to the nearest 10 000, then calculate. (a) 88 023 − 45 664 (b) 342 029 − 176553 7. Look again at the municipal budget on page 25. How much money does the municipal manager have left to buy new computers? 8. Calculate. (a) 670 034 −299 999 (b) 670 034 − 300 000 (c) 376 539 − 175 998 (d) 376 541 −176 000 835 234 687 885 147 349 27 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS a method of multiplication 6 × R3 258 can be calculated in parts, as shown below. 6 × R3 000 = R18 000 6 × R200 = R1 200 6 × R50 = R300 6 × R8 = R48 The four partial products can now be added to get the answer, which is R19 548. It is convenient to write the work in vertical columns for units, tens, hundreds and so on, as shown on the right above. In fact, if you are willing to do some hard thinking you can produce the answer with even less writing. You can achieve this by working from right to left to calculate the partial products, and by “carrying” parts of the partial answers to the next column, as you can do when working from right to left in columns. It works like this: 3 2 5 8 × 6 4 8 3 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 1 9 5 4 8 3 2 5 8 × 6 1 9 5 4 8 When 6 × 8 = 48 is calculated, only the “8” is written down, in the units column. The “4” that represents 40 is not written. It is kept “on hold” in your mind. When 6 × 50 = 300 is calculated, the 40 from the previous step is added to 300 to get 340. Again, only the “4” that represents 40 is written. The 300 is kept on hold or “carried” to add to the answer of the next step. The work continues like this. 1. Calculate each of the following. Do not use a calculator. (a) 8 × 786 (b) 9 × 3 453 (c) 60 × 786 (d) 60 × 7 860 2. You may use a calculator to check your answers for question 1. Repeat the work if your answers are not correct, so that you can learn where you make mistakes. Then put your calculator away again. 3. Use your answers for questions 1(a) and (c) to find out how much 68 × 786is. Tocalculate 36 × 378,the work can be broken up in two parts, namely 30 × 378 and 6 × 378. 2 3 4 8 × 7 6 4.

You may try to do the calculations in question 6 in this way. If you find it difficult, you may first write some of them up completely, and then try again to write less when you multiply. 6.

(a) 3 659 × 38 (b) 27 ×23 487 (c) 486 × 278 (d) 2 135 × 232 a process called long division You may use a calculator to do questions 1 to 6. 1. You want to buy some live chickens at R37 each and you have R920 available. How many live chickens can you buy in total? 2. R880 is to be shared equally among 34 learners? How many full rands can each learner get? 3. You want to buy live chickens at R47 each. You have R1 280 available. How many live chickens can you buy? 4. 42 equal bags of rice weigh a total of 7 560 g. How much does one bag weigh? 5. The number 26 was multiplied by a secret number and the answer was 2 184. What was the secret number? This is an accurate sketch of the back of a house. The red line on the sketch is 70 mm long and it shows the width of the house. The blue line on the sketch indicates the height of the chimney. Do not measure the blue line now. 29 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS The width of the actual house is 5 600 mm, and the height of the chimney is 3 360 mm. 6. (a) How many times is the house bigger than the sketch? Describe what you can do to find this out. (b) Calculate how long the blue line on the sketch should be. (c) Now measure the blue line to check your answer for (b). Division is used for different purposes: In question 1youknew that the amount is split into equal parts. You had to find out how many parts there are (how many chickens). This is called grouping. Inquestion 2you knewthatthe amount wassplitinto 34 equal parts. You needed to find out how big each part is(how much money eachlearner will get).This is called sharing. 7. (a) What does question 3 require, sharing or grouping? (b) What does question 4 require, sharing or grouping? In question 6 division was done for a different purpose than sharing or grouping. Put your calculator away now. It is very important to be able to solve division problems by using your own mind. The activities that follow will help you to do this better than before. While you work on these activities, you will often have to estimate the product of two numbers. If you can estimate products well, division becomes easier to do. Hence, to start, do question 8, which will provide you with the opportunity to practise your product estimation skills. 8. (a) What do you think is closest to 4 080: 10 × 74 or 30 × 74or 50 × 74or 70 × 74or 90 × 74? (b) Calculate some of the products to check your answer. (c) What do you think is closest to 9 238: 30 × 38 or 50 × 38 or 100 × 38 or 150 × 38 or 200 × 38 or 250 × 38 or 300 × 38? (d) Calculate some of the products to check your answer. (e) What do you think is closest to 9 746: 10 × 287 or 20 × 287 or 30 × 287 or 40 × 287 or 50 × 287 or 60 × 287 or 70 × 287? (f) Calculate some of the products to check your answer. (g) By what multiple of 10 should you multiply 27 to get as close to 6 487 as possible? 9. A principal wants to buy T-shirts for the 115 Grade 7 learners in the school. The T-shirts cost R67 each, and an amount of R8 500 is available. Do you think there is enough money to buy T-shirts for all the learners? Explain your answer. 10.(a) How much will 100 of the T-shirts cost? (b) How much money will be left if 100 T-shirts are bought? (c) How much money will be left if 20 more T-shirts are bought? 30 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 The principal wants to work out exactly how many T-shirts, at R67 each, she can buy with R8 500. Her thinking and writing are described below. Step 1 What she writes: What she thinks: 67 Step 2 I want to find out how many chunks of 67 there are in 8 500. What she writes: What she thinks: 100 I think there are at least 100 chunks of 67 in 8 500. 67 8 5 00 6 7 00 100 × 67 = 6 700. I need to know how much is left over. 1 8 00 I want to find out how many chunks of 67 there are in 1 800. Step 3 (She has to rub out the one “0” of the 100 on top, to make space.) What she writes: What she thinks: 120 I think there are at least 20 chunks of 67 in 1 800. 67 8 500 6 700 1 800 1 340 20 × 67 = 1 340. I need to know how much is left over. 460 I want to find out how many chunks of 67 there are in 460. Step 4 (She rubs out another “0”.) What she writes: What she thinks: 125 I think there are at least five chunks of 67 in 460. 67 8 500 6 700 1 800 1 340 460 335 5 × 67 = 335. I need to know how much is left over. 125 I want to find out how many chunks of 67 there are in 125. Step 5 (She rubs out the “5”.) What she writes: What she thinks: 126 I think there is only one more chunk of 67 in 125. 67 8 500 6 700 1 800 1 340 460 335 125 67 I wonder how much money will be left over. 58 So, we can buy 126 T-shirts and R58 will remain. 31 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS 8 500 Do not use a calculator in the questions that follow. The purpose of this work is foryouto develop agood understanding of how division can be done. Check all your answers by doing multiplication. 11.

How many cartons many boxes were filled? is this? 1.6 Problem solving rate and ratio You may use a calculator for doing the work in this section. 1. The people in a village get their water from a nearby dam. On a certain day the dam contains 688 000 litres of water. The village people use about 85 000 litres of water each day. For how many days will the water in the dam last, if no rains fall? Insteadofsaying “85000litres each day”or“8cm each hour”, people often say “at a rateof 85 000 litres per day” or “at a rate of 8 cm perhour”. 2. During a period of very heavy rain, the water level in a certain river increases at a rate of 8 cm each hour. If it continues like this, by how much will the water level increase in 24 hours? 3. A woman is driving from Johannesburg to Durban. Her distance from Durban decreases at a rate of about 95 km per hour. How far does she travel, approximately, in four hours? 32 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 4. The number of unemployed people in a certain province increases at a rate of approximately 35 000 people per year.If there were 860 000 unemployed people in the year 2000, how many unemployed people will there be, approximately, in the year 2020? 5. In pattern A below, there are five red beads for every four yellow beads. Describe patterns B and C in the same way. Pattern A Pattern B Pattern C In a certain food factory, two machines are used to produce tins of baked beans. Machine A produces at a rate of 800 tins per hour, and machine B produces at a rate of 2 400 tins per hour. 6. (a) Copy and complete the following table, to show how many tins of beans will be produced by the two machines, in different periods of time. Number of hours 1 2 3 5 8 Number of tins produced by machine A 800 1 600 2 400 4 000 Number of tins produced by machine B 2 400 4 800 (b) How much faster is machine B than machine A? (c) How many tins will be produced by machine B in the time that it takes machine A to produce 30 tins? (d) How many tins will be produced by machine B in the time that it takes machine A to produce 200 tins? (e) How many tins will be produced by machine B in the time that it takes machine A to produce one tin? The patterns in question 5 can be described like this: In pattern A, the ratio of yellow beads to red beads is 4 to 5. This is written as 4 : 5. In pattern B, the ratio between yellow beads and red beads is 3 : 6, and in pattern C the ratio is 2 : 7. In question 6, machine A produces one tin for every three tins that machine B produces. This can be described by saying that the ratio between the produc- tion speeds of machines A and B is 1 : 3. 33 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS 7. Twohuge trucks are travelling very slowly on a highway. Truck A covers 20 km per hour, and truck B covers 30 km per hour. Both trucks keep these speeds all the time.

This means Sally gets R5 for every R3 David gets. How much will David and Sally each get in total? 9. How much will each person get, if R14 400 is shared between two people in each of the following ways? (a) In the ratio 1 : 3 (b) In the ratio 5 : 7 financial mathematics A man borrows R12 000 from a bank for one year. He has to pay 15% interest to the bank. This means that, apart from paying the R12 000 back to the bank after a year, he has to pay 15 hundredths of R12 000 for the privilege of using the money that actually belongs to the bank. One hundredth of R12 000 can be calculated by dividing R12 000 by 100. This amount can then be multiplied by 15 to get 15 hundredths of R12 000. Do not use a calculator when you do the following questions. 1. Calculate 12 000 ÷ 100, then multiply the answer by 15. 2. Calculate: (a) 12% of R8 000 (b) 18% of R24 000 3. In each case below, calculate how much interest must be paid. (a) An amount of R6 000 is borrowed for one year at 9% interest. (b) An amount of R21 000 is borrowed for three years at 11% interest peryear. (c) An amount of R45 000 is borrowed for ten years at 12% interest per year. 34 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 The money paid for using another person’s house is called rent. The money paid for using another person’s money is called interest. 15% is read as 15 per cent, and it is just a different way to say 15 hundredths. A car dealer buys a car for R60 000 and sells it for R75000. The difference of R15000 is called the profit. In this case, the profit is a quarter of R60 000, which is the same as 25 hundredths or 25%. This can be described by saying “the car dealer made a profit of 25%”. 4. Calculate the amount of profit in each of the following cases. The information is about a car dealer who buys and sells used vehicles. (a) A car is bought for R40 000 and sold for R52 000. (b) A small truck is bought for R100 000 and sold at a profit of 28%. (c) A bakkie is bought for R120 000 and sold at a profit of 30%. A shop owner bought a stove for R2 000 and sold it for R1 600. The shop owner did not make a profit, he sold the stove at a loss of R400. 5. (a) How much is one hundredth of R2 000? (b) How many hundredths of R2 000 is R400? (c) How much is 20% of R2 000? Notice that by doing question 5(b) you have worked out at what percentage loss the shop owner sold the stove. 6. The shop owner also sold a fridge that normally sells for R4 000 at a discount of 20%. This means the customer paid 20% less than the normal price. Calculate the discount in rands and the amount that the customer paid for the fridge. 35 CHAPTER 1: WORKING WITH WHOLE NUMBERS 2.1 Quick squares and cubes again and again 1.

It is repeated three times. 2. Which numbers in question 1 have repeated factors? In each case, state what number is repeated as a factor and how many times it is repeated. A number that can be expressed as a product of one repeated factor is called a power of that number. Examples: 32 is a power of 2, because 32 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 100 000 is a power of 10, because 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 100 000 3. Express each number as a power of 2, 3, 5 or 10.

The number 5 is bigger than 3 and we express this in mathematical language as 5 > 3. The symbol < is used to indicate that the number on the left-hand side of the symbol is smaller than the number on the right-hand side. The number 3 is smaller than 5 and we express this mathematically as 3 < 5. Whennumbers havethesame value, we use the equal sign(=).

We say that the numbers 25, 16, 9, 4, 1, ... are arranged in descending order. 1.

Suppose you want to calculate 11 × 12. 11 2 has a value of 121. We know that 11 × 11 = 121. 11 × 12 means that there are 12 elevens in total. So 11 × 12 = 11 × 11 + 11 = 121 + 11 = 132 Suppose you want to calculate 11 × 17. 11 × 17 = 17 elevens in total = 11 elevens + 6 elevens Well, we know that 11 × 11 = 121 So 11 × 17 = 11 × 11 + 6 × 11 = 121 + 66 = 187 Now do the following calculations in your exercise book, using your knowledge of square numbers. 1. 11 × 19 2. 13 × 16 3. 15 × 18 4. 12 × 18 47 CHAPTER 2: EXPONENTS 3 125 36 + 64 16 6 2.6 Calculations the order of operations When a numerical expression includes more than one operation, for example both multiplication and addition, what you do first makes a difference. If there are no brackets in a numerical expression, it means that multiplication and division must be done first, and addition and subtraction only later. For example, the expression 12 + 3 × 5 means “multiply 3 by 5; then add 12”. It does not mean “add 12 and 3; then multiply by 5”. If you wish to specify that addition should be done first, that part of the expression should be put in brackets. For example, if you wish to say “add 5 and 12; then multiply by 3”, the numerical expression should be 3 × (5 + 12) or (5 + 12) × 3. Here is another example: The expression 10 − 6 ÷ 3 means “divide 6 by 3; then subtract the answer from 10”. It does not mean “subtract 6 from 10; then divide by 3”. If you wish to specify that subtraction should be done first, that part of the expression should be put in brackets. The numerical expression (10 − 6) ÷ 3 means “subtract 6 from 10; then divide the answer by 3”. writing numerical expressions in words 1.

Draw a line segment that is 12 cm long. lines and rays We can think of lines that have no ends, although we cannot draw them completely. We draw line segments to represent lines. When we draw a line segment to represent a line, we may put arrows at both ends to show that it goes on indefinitely on both sides. M The word line is used to indicate a line that goes on in both directions. We can only see and draw part of a line. A line cannot bemeasured. 1. Draw line AB. 2. Did you draw the whole of line AB? Explain. We can also think of a line that has a definite starting point but goes on indefinitely at the other end. This is called a half-line or a ray. We can draw the starting point and part of a ray, using an arrow to indicate that it goes on at the one end.

If the directions are almost the same, we say the angle between them is small. If the directions are very different, we say the angle between them is big. Words we use to describe angles: • Arms of the angle: the two lines that are at an angle to each other • The vertex: the point where the two armsmeet • Vertices: plural of “vertex” Symbols to describe angles: Arrowheads on the lines mean that the lines keep on going. The length of an angle’s arms does not change the size of the angle. Whether the arms are long or short, the angle size stays the same. There are two angles at a vertex so it is important to show which one we are talking about. Labelling angles: There are many different ways to label angles. Look at the examples below: vertex The arc shows where the angle is Using a dot or a star Angle 1 Right angle (90°) 1 arm arm 57 CHAPTER 4: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES You can name the angle on the right in different A ways: you can say AB  C or CB  A or just B  .

Describe how you found your answer. (Hint: A piece of scrap paper may help!) 5. Two lines are drawn by holding down a ruler and drawing lines on both sides. What can you say about the two lines? 6. Look at the analogue clock face on the next page. The minute hand and the hour hand make an angle. Focus on the smaller angle for now. 58 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 (a) Explain why the angle between the hands at 8 o’ clock is the same size as the angle at 4 o’ clock. (b) Compare the angle at 2 o’ clock with the angle at 4 o’ clock. What do you notice? Why is thisso? (c) Is the angle at 3 o’ clock the same as the angle at a quarter past 12? Explain. 7. When you open the cover of a hardcover book you can make different angles. Can you think of at least five other situations in everyday life where objects are turned through angles? Say what the arms and the vertices are in each of your examples. 4.2 The degree: a unit for measuring angles Imagine if we didn’t have units for measuring length. How would tailors make clothes to the right size without a tape measure? How could an architect design a safe and beautiful house without a ruler? How could we lay out a professional soccer field without being able to measure accurately in metres? We need units and measuring instruments in many situations. You know that we use metres, centimetres, kilometres, millimetres, etc. for measuring lengths. We should also have units for measuring angles. The units we use for measuring angles are very ancient. No one today is completely sure why, but our ancestors decided many thousands of years ago that a revolution should be divided into 360 equal parts. We call these parts degrees. The symbol for a degree is °. some familiar angles in degrees 1. Copy and complete the table by filling in the size of each angle described. Angle (in words) Angle (degrees) right angle 90° straight angle revolution 360° half a right angle a third of a right angle a quarter of a right angle 22,5° half a straight angle three quarters of a revolution a third of a revolution 59 CHAPTER 4: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES 11 12 1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 6 5 2. Look at the clock shown. How many degrees does: (a) the minute hand move in an hour? (b) the hour hand move in an hour? 1 hour later 3. In Grade 6 you learnt that angles are classified into types. Copy and complete the table. The first one has been done as an example for you. Angle Size of the angle Sketch of the angle Acute angle Between 0° and 90° Right angle Obtuse angle Straight angle Reflex angle Revolution comparing angles using a4 paper You need a sheet of A4 paper. At the corners you have four right angles. Number them and tear the corners off as shown in the diagram. Do not make them too small. Now use your right angles to investigate the following situations: 1. Show that a straight angle is two right angles. You can sketch what you have done in your book. 2. Show that a revolution is four right angles. You can sketch what you have done in your book. 3. Create a right angle using three of your corners. You can sketch what you have done in your book. 4. Describe how you can use one of your corners to check if an angle is acute, right or obtuse. 5. (a) Fold corner 1 so that you can use it to measure 45°. (b) Fold corner 2 so that you can use it to measure 30°. (c) Fold corner 3 so that you can use it to measure 22,5°. (d) Which is bigger: a right angle or half a right angle + a third of a right angle + a quarter of a right angle? Can you do a calculation to show that? Important: Keep your folded pieces of paper for the next lesson! 60 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 11 12 1 10 2 9 8 3 4 7 6 5 11 12 1 10 2 9 8 3 4 7 6 5 1 2 4 3 4.3 Using the protractor We have a special instrument for measuring angles. It is called a protractor. Look at the picture of a typical protractor with its important parts labelled. Protractors can be big or small but they all clockwise degree scale 90 anticlockwise degree scale degree marks measure angles in exactly the same way. The size ofthe protractor makes no difference to an angle’s size. origin base line measuring some familiar angles You need the four folded angles from the previous activity on page 60. If you didn’t do that activity, then go back now and follow the instructions in question 5. 1. In a group of three or four, use your protractor to measure the angles that you made: 90°; 45°; 30° and 22,5°. 2. Did you measure the correct sized angle? If not, then ask yourself the following questions: • Did you put the vertex of the angle at the origin of the protractor? • Is the bottom arm of your angle lined up with the base line? • Did you fold your corners correctly? how to use a protractor to measure an angle Step 1: Are the angle arms long enough? The angle arms must be a little longer than the distance from the origin of the protractor to its edge. If they are too short, use a sharp pencil and a ruler to make them longer. Be careful to line the ruler up with the arm. ✗ ruler not lined up ✗ only a small part of the arm is used carefully (at an angle to the arm) ✓✓ ruler lined up carefully and the whole arm is used 61 CHAPTER 4: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES 180 0 0 180 180 0 0 180 Now you are ready to start measuring your angle. Step 2: Line up the angle and your protractor Place your protractor on top of the angle. Make sure of the following: • the origin is exactly on the vertex of the angle, and • the base line is exactly on top of one of the arms of the angle. Keep adjusting the position of the protractor until the origin and the base line are exactly lined up. 90 origin exactly on top of the vertex ✓ ✗ base line at an angle to arm 90 origin not on top of the vertex base line exactly on top of ✗ ✓ arm origin exactly on top of the vertex and base line exactly on top ofarm Once your protractor is in the correct place, keep a finger on the protractor to stop it from moving. If it moves... start again! You are now ready to make a measurement. 62 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 90 ✓ ✓ 180 0 180 0 0 180 0 180 Step 3: Measure the angle A protractor gives a clockwise degree scale and an anticlockwise degree scale. Youchoose the correct scale by finding the one that starts with 0° on the angle arm. Look at where the other angle arm passes under the degree scale. That is where your measurement is. 90 Here we must use the inner scale (goes anticlockwise from the base line). You can also place the protractor on the angle using the other arm. Then the correct position looks like this: Here we must use the outer scale (goes clockwise from the base line). The angle in the pictures above is 37°. Do you agree? Do you see that there are two ways to measure an angle? practise measuring with a protractor 1. Measure the angles and copy and complete the table on the next page.

How do angles 3 and 4 compare? 2. What about angles 6 and 7? 3. What about angles 4 and 5? 4. There are some interesting ideas here. Try to do some further investigation and show your teacher what you discover. 64 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 4.4 Using a protractor to construct angles constructing angles to a given line Work together with a partner on this activity. You need your protractor, a sharp pencil and a straight ruler. 1. Your first challenge is to copy the line below and construct a line at exactly right angles to it. Begin by choosing a point on the line. You must mark this point clearly and neatly with a small dot. Then use your understanding of a protractor to draw a 90° angle. 2. Now copy Steps 2 to 4 and fill in the missing words. Step 1: Choose a point anywhere on the line. Make a small mark on the line. (You don’t always have a choice here. Sometimes you must use a specific point on the line.) Step 2: Place the protractor with its on the line and its origin exactly on top of the Step 3: Make a small, clear mark at the Step 4: Use a ruler to line up the two and draw a straight line that passes exactly through them. 3. Copy the line below and use it to construct the angles listed below. The line below will be one arm of the angles you are going to construct. The vertex for each of your angles is the point labelled O where the tiny vertical line cuts the long horizontal one. Your angles must be measured anticlockwise from the line. (a) 23° (b) 45° (c) 65° (d) 79° (e) 90° (f) 121° (g) 154° (h) 180° (i) 200° (j) 270° (k) 300° angle direction The line you have been given below is called a reference line. Mathematicians usually measure angles anticlock- wise from the reference line. O S R 4. Copy the line on the right. Then at each end, draw lines at an angle of 60° to form a triangle. What sort of triangle is this? 5. Copy and complete the quadrilateral below. The angle at P must be 52° and the one at Q, must be 23°. P Q 4.5 Parallel and perpendicular lines Perpendicular lines meet each other at an angle of 90°. The sketch shows two perpendicular lines. We say: AB is perpendicular to DC. We write: AB ⊥DC Parallel lines never meet each other. They are an Q equal distance apart. They have the same direction. The sketch shows two parallel lines. We say: PQ is parallel to RS. P We write: PQ //RS The arrows on the middle of the lines show that the lines are parallel to each other. constructing perpendicular and parallel lines When constructing parallel lines, remember that the lines always stay the same distance apart. Follow the steps on page 67 to draw perpendicular and parallel lines using a pro- tractor and a ruler. 66 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 D A 90° B C A 90° C 1. We want to draw a line that is parallel to XY and that passes through point A. A X Y Step 1: Draw a perpendicular line between A and XY. Copy the line XY above. Use your protractor to draw a line that goes through A and is at 90° to XY. Labelthepoint Cwhereyour new line touches XY. Look at the sketch on the right if you get stuck. X Step 2: Measure the perpendicular distance between the point and Y the line. Write down the length of AC. Step 3: Draw a point that is the same distance from the line. Then draw another line that is perpendicular to line XY. Mark off the same length as AC on that line. The sketch below shows what you must do. X Y 67 CHAPTER 4: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES A 90° C 90° Step 4: Draw the parallel line. Join A with the new point that is an equal distance away from XY. You now have a parallel line. 2. Practise constructing perpendicular and parallel lines using a protractor and a ruler. 4.6 Circles are very special figures And now for something slightly different ... let us have a look at circles. a circle with string You may need to work with a partner here. You need two sharp pencils and a short length of string, an A4 sheet of paper and a ruler. 1. Tie the string to both pencils with double knots. The knots must be firm but not tight. The string must swing easily around the pencils without falling off. Once you have tied your string, the distance between the pencils when the string is tight should not be more than 8 cm. 2. Your partner must hold one pencil vertically with its point near the centre of the sheet of paper. 3. Now carefully move the tip of the other pencil around the middle one, drawing as you go. Try to keep the string stretched and the pencil vertical as you draw. If you have been careful, you will have drawn a circle (well, hopefully something pretty close to a circle). You can swop now so your partner also has a turn drawing while you hold the centre pencil. 4. Mark three points on the circle line. Measure the distance between the point and the centre of the circle for each. If you have a circle you should find that the distances are the same. A X C Y 68 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 Circles are special for many reasons. The most important reason is the following: The distance from the centre of a circle to the edge is the same in any direction. This distance is called the radius. We pronounce this: “ray-dee-us”. The plural of radiusis radii. We pronounce this: “ray-dee-eye”. Do you agree that the two pencils and string are not a good way to draw circles? The string is stretchy. It is difficult to change the radius. And, the drawing pencil can wander off course and make a spiral or a wobbly curve. We need something better. 4.7 Using the compass We need a special instrument for drawing circles. It must have a pointy tip, like the centre pencil. It must also have a drawing tip, like the pencil you moved. If you can set the distance between these two tips, you can draw circles of any radius. This instrument is called a pair of compasses, or often just a compass. This is the point that goes at the centre of your circle. The pencil tip must turn around this point. This gap will be the radius of your circle. You can set the gap to the correct radius using your ruler. Change the gap by changing the angle between the arms of the compass. Here is the handle of the compass. You hold it between your forefinger and thumb. Only use one hand when you draw a circle. Turn the compass by twisting it between your forefinger and thumb. Clamp your sharpened pencil tightly in here. The tip of the pencil must be next to the tip of the turning point when you push the arms together. 69 CHAPTER 4: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES think about it Can you think of any other figure where the distance between the centre and the edge is constant in all directions? • A square? • A hexagon? • What about an oval shape (ellipse)? do some investigation to see what you can find. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 constructing circles with a compass 1. You will see a point labelled A below. Follow the steps below and on the next page to draw a circle with a radius of 2 cm. The centre must be at A. Step 1: Place the pointed tip on the zero line of your ruler. Carefully widen the angle between the arms. Move the pencil tip until it is exactly at 2 cm. Make sure that the pointed tip is still on zero. Be careful not to change the gap once it is set to 2 cm. Step 2: Mark point A in the centre of your page. Gently push the pointed tip into point A. Push just deep enough into the paper to keep it in place. This will be the centre of your circle. Step 1 Step 4 A Step 3: Hold the handle between the forefinger and thumb of your writing hand. Keep your other hand out of the way. Use only one hand when you draw a circle with a compass. Step 4: Twist the handle between your thumb and forefinger. If you are right-handed, it is easiest to twist the compass clockwise. If you are left-handed, turn the compass anticlockwise. Let the pencil tip drag over the paper. Don’t push down too hard on the pencil. Rather, push down lightly on the pointed arm as you draw. The pencil tip must move smoothly and easily. 2. Then draw concentric circles at centre A with radii of 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm and 6 cm. Set the gap carefully each time. Write the radius on the edge of each circle. Learning to use a compass is like learning to ride a bicycle. It takes co-ordination and practice. Don’t be embarrassed if it goes wrong. With practice you will get very good at it. If your circles end up being all wobbly lines, just begin again! 70 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 concentric circles have the same midpoint. Here are some tips for drawing circles: • If your circles are turning into spirals it is because the arms of your compass have moved. Check their width again against a ruler. • If the arms of your compass won’t stay in the position you set them at, it is because the nut at the hinge below the handle is loose. Ask your teacher to help you if you can’t tighten it yourself. • If you can’t do the twist, imagine you have a small piece of soft clay between your thumb and forefinger and you are trying to roll it into a small strip. The twist for turning your compass uses the same type of sliding movement. Let the compass hang from your hand in the air and twist the handle. Then try it on scrap paper a few times until you can turn the compass easily. circles on circles It’s time to have some fun with the compass while getting better at using it. Follow these instructions to draw the beautiful pattern shown on the right in your exercise book. 1. Make sure your pencil is sharp; then place it in the compass. 2. Set the radius to 4 cm. Draw a circle at the centre of your page. Important: your radius must stay the same for the whole activity. 3. Put your compass point anywhere on the circle edge. Draw another circle. This circle should pass through the centre of your first circle (they have the same radius). 4. Your second circle cuts the first circle at two points. Choose one of these points. Place your compass point at this point. Draw another circle of radius 4 cm. 5. Repeat step 3 with your third circle, fourth circle etc. You should end up with six circles on your first circle. That is, seven circles in total. 6. Decorate it as you please. (You can decorate your pattern further by adding more circles or joining points with straight lines, and so on. See what patterns and shapes you can discover among all the circles.) 71 CHAPTER 4: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES 4.8 Using circles to draw other figures geometric figures hiding in the circles Below is a set of seven circles like the one you drew. Sit with a partner and try to find hidden polygons. You will find these polygons by joining the points where the circles cut each other. The points will be the vertices of the polygons. Look carefully. There are triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons and hexagons. When you can see them, neatly and carefully rule in their sides with a pencil. If there is not enough space on the set of circles below, redraw the circles on a separate piece of paper and show the figures there. If you wish, you can measure the angles at each vertex and the lengths of the sides. Arcs of circles We do not have to draw whole circles to construct figures. We are only really interested in the points where the circles cross each other, so we could just draw arcs where they cross. Next year, you will use arcs in your geometric constructions. 72 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 An arc is a small part of a circle. We use the term circumference when we refer to the distance around a circle or around any other curved shape. This is a full circle. This is only part of a circle. A part of a circle like this is called an arc. This arc is smaller. This arc is almost a full circle. This arc is just more than a semi-circle. This arc is a quarter circle. Do the following in your exercise book: 1. Draw an arc using a radius of 3 cm. 2. Draw an arc bigger than a quarter circle, using a radius of 5 cm. 3. Draw an arc smaller than a quarter circle, using a radius of 5 cm. enrichment Once you have finished the work in section 4.8, experiment with drawing only the arcs that you need in various constructions. Here is an example to show how to construct a regular hexagon with only arcs: 73 CHAPTER 4: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES familiar figures in the seven-circle pattern For this activity you need five seven-circle sets like the ones drawn in the previous two activities. Start by drawing these on blank pieces of paper. Don’t make your radius bigger than 4 cm. Number your sets figure 2 to figure 6. Label each figure as shown on the right. 1. Copy the figure above right by following the instructions below. • Figure 1: Draw lines connecting AB, BC, CD, ... up to FA. • Figure 2: Draw lines connecting A, O and B. • Figure 3: Draw lines connecting B, F and D. • Figure 4: Draw lines connecting BC, CE, EF and FB. • Figure 5: Draw lines connecting CD, DE, EF and FC. • Figure 6: Draw lines connecting AB, BC, CE and EA. 2. Copy and complete the table below. It shows the name of each figure and its properties. Figure 1 (on the right) has been done as an example.

Copy the seven-circle figure below. The intersection points have been marked. A line segment has been drawn in. Use a ruler and pencil to join pairs of points so that the lines are: (a) parallel to the line segment (b) perpendicular to the line segment. Youshould have drawn seven lines (two parallel and five perpendicular to the line segment). Compare your lines with a friend’s lines. Do you agree? 3. Draw a few circles with the same radius along a line. Start by drawing a line. Then use your compass to draw a circle with the midpoint on the line. 76 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 When two lines (or arcs) cross each other we say they intersect. The intersection point is the place where they meet. Keep your compass the same width and draw another circle with the centre where the first circle crossed the line.

(b) Draw lines MA, MB and MC from M to the red points A, B and C. The three red points are on the circle with midpoint M. A straight line, such as AC, drawn across a circle and passing through its midpoint is called the diameter of the circle. 88 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 1 A B C A 2. Measure MA, MB and MC. If MA, MB and MC are equal in length, you have chosen the midpoint well. If they are not equal, you may wish to improve your sketch of a circle and its parts. A straight line from the midpoint of a circle to a point on the circle is called a radius of the circle. The blue line, MA, is a radius. Any straight line from the centre to the circle is a radius. The black line AB joins two points on the circle. We call this line a chord of the circle. In the following two diagrams, the coloured sections are segments of a circle. A segment is the area between a chord and an arc. B B In the circle on the right, the red section is called a sector of a circle. As you can see, a sector is the region between two radii and an arc. 89 CHAPTER 5: GEOMETRY OF 2d SHAPES A M A B M 5.5 Similar and congruent shapes Three groups of quadrilaterals are shown on this page and the next.

The grey measuring stick below is exactly one greystick long. You will use this stick to measure different objects. The red bar below is exactly two greysticks long. As you can see, the yellow bar below is longer than one greystick but shorter than two greysticks. Totry to measure the yellow bar accurately, we will divide one greystick into six equal parts: So each of these parts is one sixth of a greystick. This greystick ruler is divided into seven equal parts: Each part is one seventh of a greystick. 1. Do you think one can say the yellow bar is one and four sixths of a greystick long? 95 CHAPTER 6: FRACTIONS 2. Describe the length of the blue bar, on the previous page, in words. 3.

(b) How many fourths (or quarters) of a greystick is the same length as 15 twentieths of a greystick? describe the same length in different ways Two fractions may describe the same length. You can see here that three sixths of a greystick is the same as four eighths of a greystick. When two fractions describe the same portion we say they are equivalent. 1. (a) What can each small part on this greystick be called? (b) How many eighteenths is one sixth of the greystick? (c) How many eighteenths is one third of the greystick?

(a) What part of this strip is blue, what part is red and what part is white? (b) Express your answer differently with equivalent fractions. 6. A certain strip is not shown here. Two ninths of the strip is blue, and three ninths of the strip is green. The rest of the strip is red. What part of the strip is red? 7. What part of the strip below is yellow, what part is blue, and what part is red? The number of parts in a fraction is called the numerator of the fraction. For example, the numerator in five sixths is five. The type of part in a fraction is called the denominator. It is the name of the parts that are being referred to and it is determined by the size of the part. For example, sixths is the denominator in five sixths. 5 / 6 is a short way to write five sixths. We may also write 5 . 6 Even when we write / 6 or 6 , we still say “five sixths”. / 6 and 6 are short ways to write sixths. 99 CHAPTER 6: FRACTIONS To enumerate means “to find the number of”. To denominate means “to give a name to”. 5 7 The numerator (number of parts) is written above the line of the fraction: numerator ... The denominator is indicated by a number written below the line: ... denominator 8. Consider the fraction three quarters. It can be written as 3 . 4 (a) Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by two to form a new fraction. Is the new fraction equivalent to 3 ? 4 You may check on the diagram.

What is the total length of road that they built in the two weeks? She thought like this to solv 1 e 0 the problem: 8 is eight twelfths and 12 18 12 is ten twelfths, so altogether it is eighteen twelfths. I can write 12 or “18 twelfths”. I can also say 12 twelfths of a kilometre is 1 kilometre, so 18 twelfths is 1 km and 6 twelfths of a kilometre. This I can write as 1 6 1 12 . It is the same as 1 2 km. Gertie was also asked the question: How much is 4 9 + 2 9 ? She thought like this to answer it: 5 7 4 9 is four wholes and five ninths, and 2 9 is two wholes and seven ninths. So altogether it is six wholes and 12 ninths. But 12 ninths is nine ninths (one whole) and three ninths, so I can say it is seven wholes and three ninths. 3 I can write 7 9 . 100 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 2 1.

After the work you did in questions 9, 10 and 11,you know that: • 24 and 3 are just two ways to describe the same thing, and 12 5 40 5 • 7 of 3 is therefore the same as 7 of 24 . 12 5 12 40 It is easy to calculate 7 of 24 : one twelfth of 24 is 2, so seven twelfths of 24 is 14, so 12 40 seven twelfths of 24 fortieths is 14 fortieths. 3 of 2 can be calculated in the same way. But one eighth of 2 is a slight problem, 8 3 2 3 so it would be better to use some equivalent of 3 . The equivalent should be chosen so that it is easy to calculate one eighth of it; so it would be nice if the numerator could be eight. 8 is equivalent to 2 , so instead of calculating 3 of 2 we may calculate 3 of 8 . 12 13.(a) Calculate 3 8 3 of 8 . 12 8 3 8 12 (b) So, how much is 3 8 of 2 ? 3 14.

CHAPTER 7: THE dECIMAL NOTATION FOR FRACTIONS 111 The same quantity can be expressed in different ways in tenths and hundredths. For example, three tenths and 17 hundredths can be expressed as twotenths and 27hundredths or four tenths and seven hundredths. All over the world, people have agreed to keep the number of hundredths in such statements below ten. This means that the normal way of expressing the above quantity is four tenths and seven hundredths. Written in decimal notation, four tenths and seven hundredths is 0,47.

A decimal fraction is rounded off to the number whose value is closest to it. Therefore 13,24 rounded off to one decimal place is 13,2 and 13,26 rounded off to one decimal place is 13,3. A decimal ending in a 5 is an equal distance from the two numbers to which it can be rounded off. Such decimals are rounded off to the biggest number, so 13,15 rounded off to one decimal place becomes 13,2.

CHAPTER 7: THE dECIMAL NOTATION FOR FRACTIONS 125 8.1 Constant and variable quantities look for connections between quantities 1. (a) How many fingers does a person who is 14 years old have? (b) How many fingers does a person who is 41 years old have? (c) Does the number of fingers on a person’s hand depend on their age? Explain. There are two quantities in the above situation: age and the number of fingers on a person’s hand. The number of fingers remains the same, irrespective of a person’s age. So we say the number of fingers is a constant quantity. However, age changes, or varies, so we say age is a variablequantity. 2. Now consider each situation below. For each situation, state whether one quantity influences the other. If it does, try to say how the one quantity will influence the other quantity. Also say whether there is a constant in the situation. (a) The number of calls you make and the amount of airtime left on your cell phone (b) The number of houses to be built and the number of bricks required (c) The number of learners at a school and the duration of the Mathematics period If one variable quantity is influenced by another, we say there is a relationship between the two variables. It is sometimes possible to find out what value of the one quantity, in other words, what number is linked to a specific value of the othervariable. 3.

You can think of a dimension as a direction in space. Look at these examples: 2D shape: rectangle 3D object: rectangular prism height length breadth length breadth 3D objects therefore take up space in a way that 2D shapes do not. We can measure the amount of space that 3D objects take up. cubes to measure amount of space We can use cubes to measure the amount of space that an object takes up. 1. Identical toy building cubes were used to make the stacks shown below. A B C E F 150 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 2 d Every object in the real world is 3d. Even a sheet of paper is a 3d object. Its height is about 0,1 mm. (a) Which stack takes up the least space? (b) Which stack takes up the most space? (c) Order the stacks from the one that takes up the least space to the one that takes up the most space. (Write the letters of the stacks.) The space (in all directions) occupied by a 3D object is called its volume. Cubes are the units we use to measure volume. A cube with edges of 1 cm (that is, 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm) has a volume of one cubic centimetre (1 cm 3 ). 2. The figure on the right shows a rectangular prism made from 36 cubes, each with an edge length of 1 cm. The prism thus has a volume of 36 cubic centimetres (36 cm 3 ). 1 cm 1 cm 1 cm (a) The stack is taken apart and all 36 cubes are stacked again to make a new rectangular prism with a base of four cubes (see A below.) How many layers of cubes will the new prism be? What is the height of the new prism? A B (b) Repeat (a), but this time make a prism with a base of six cubes (see B above). (c) Which one of the rectangular prisms in questions (a) and (b) takes up the most space in all directions? (Which one has the greatest volume?) (d) What will be the volume of the prism in question (b) if there are seven layers of cubes altogether? (e) A prism is built with 48 cubes, each with an edge length of 1 cm. The base consists of eight layers. What is the height of the prism? formula to calculate volume You can think about the volume of a rectangular prism in the following way: Step 1: Measure the area of the bottom face (also called the base) of a rectangular prism. For the prism b = three l = six units given here: A = l × b= 6 × 3 = 18square units. units 151 CHAPTER 10: SURFACE AREA ANd VOLUME OF 3d OBJECTS Step 2: A layer of cubes, each one unit high, is placed on the flat base. The base now holds 18 cubes. It is 6 × 3 × 1 cubic units. b = three units l = six units h = one unit Step 3: Three more layers of cubes are added so that there are fourlayers altogether. The prism’s height(h) b = three l = six units is four units. The volume of the prism is: V = (6 × 3) × 4 or V = Area of base × number of layers = (l × b) × h units h = four units Therefore: Volume of a rectangular prism = Area of base × height = l × b × h Volume of a cube = l × l× l (edges are all the same length) = l 3 applying the formulae 1.

Calculate the volume ofthe following square-based prisms: (a) side of the base = 5 mm, h = 12 mm (b) side of the base = 11 m, h = 800cm 5. The volume of a prism is 375 m 3 . What is the height of the prism if its length is 8 m and its breadth is 15 m? 10.3 Converting between cubic units cubic units to measure volume This drawing shows a cube (A) with an edge length of 1 m. Also shown is a small cube (B) with an edge length of 1 cm. cube A (1 m3) How many small cubes can fit inside the large cube? • 100 small cubes can fit along the length of the base of cube A (because there are 100 cm in 1 m). • 100small cubes can fit along the breadth of the base of cube A. • 100 small cubes can fit along the height of cube A.

Calculate the volume of each of the following rectangular prisms: (a) length = 20 cm; breadth = 15 cm; height = 10 cm (b) length = 130 mm; breadth = 10 cm; height = 5 mm (c) length = 1 200 cm; breadth = 5,5 m; height = 3m (d) length = 1,2 m; breadth = 2,25 m; height = 4 m (e) area of base = 300 cm 2 ; height = 150 mm (f) area of base = 12 m 2 ; height = 2,25 m 10.4 Volume and capacity The space inside a container is called the internal volume, or capacity, of the container. Capacity is often measured in units of millilitres (ml), litres (ℓ) and kilolitres (kl). However, it can also be measured in cubic units. equivalent units for volume and capacity If the contents of a 1 ℓ bottle are poured into a cube- shaped container with internal measurements of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm, it will fill the container exactly. Thus: (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) = 1 ℓ or 1 000 cm 3 = 1 ℓ 10 cm Since ∴ 1 ℓ 1 000 cm 3 1 cm 3 = = = 1 000 ml 1 000 ml 1 ml 10 cm [1 ℓ = 1 000 cm 3 ] [divide both sides by 1 000] Since 1 kl = = = = 1 000 ℓ 1 000 × (1 000 cm 3 ) 1 000 000 cm 3 1 m 3 [1 ℓ = 1 000 cm 3 ] [1 000 000 cm 3 = 1 m 3 ] This means that an object with a volume of 1 cm 3 will take up the same amount of space as 1 ml of water. Or an object with a volume of 1 m 3 will take up the space of 1 kl of water. 1 litre 10 cm 155 CHAPTER 10: SURFACE AREA ANd VOLUME OF 3d OBJECTS The following diagram shows the conversions in another way: 1 ml ⟶ 1 ℓ (or 1 000 ml) ⟶ 1 kl (or 1 000 ℓ) 1 cm 3 ⟶ 1 000 cm 3 ⟶ 1 m 3 (or 1 000 000 cm 3 ) From the diagram on the previous page, you can see that: • 1 ℓ = 1 000 ml; 1 ml = 0,001 ℓ • 1 kl = 1 000 ℓ; 1 ℓ = 0,001 kl • 1 ml = 1 cm 3 • 1 ℓ = 1 000 cm 3 • 1 kl = 1 000 000 cm 3 or 1 m 3 Remember these conversions: 1 ml = 1 cm 3 1 kl = 1 m 3 volume and capacity calculations 1.

In this case, it refers to changes between equivalent units of measurement. 156 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 2 4. A vase is shaped like a rectangular prism.

(c) What is the volume of the liquid after it is poured into the tank? 20 cm 20 cm 2 litre (2 000 cm3) h cm (height of liquid) 20 cm (d) What is the capacity of the tank? (e) How high does the liquid go in the tank? In question 5 above, you should have found the following: Volume of liquid in tank = Volume of liquid in bottle 20 × 20 × h (liquid’s height in tank) = 2 000 cm 3 h = 2000 (20 × 20) = 5 cm Note: The capacity of the tank is 20 cm × 20 cm × 20 cm = 8 000 cm 3 (8 ℓ). The volume of liquid in the bottle is 2 000 cm 3 (2 ℓ). 157 CHAPTER 10: SURFACE AREA ANd VOLUME OF 3d OBJECTS Worksheet 1.

What may the next three numbers in each of these sequences be? 4; 8; 12; 16; 20; ... 4; 8; 16; 32; 64; ... 4; 8; 14; 22; 32; ... 5; 7; 4; 8; 3; 9; 2; ... A set of numbers in a given order is called a number sequence. In some cases each number in a sequence can be formed from the previous number by performing the same or a similar action. In such a case, we can say there is a pattern in the sequence. 1. (a) Write down the next three numbers in each of these sequences: Sequence A: 4; 7; 10; 13; 16;... Sequence B: 5; 10; 20; 40; 80; ... Sequence C: 2; 5; 10; 17; 26; ... (b) Write down how you decided what the next numbers would be in each of the three sequences. A sequence can be formed by repeatedly adding or subtracting the same number. In this case the difference between one term and the next is constant. A sequence can be formed by repeatedly multiplying or dividing by the same number. In this case the ratio between one term and the next is constant. A sequence can also be formed in such a way that neither the difference nor the ratio between one term and the next is constant. 159 CHAPTER 11: NUMERIC ANd GEOMETRIC PATTERNS The numbers in a sequence are called the terms of the sequence. Terms that follow one another are said to be consecutive. In sequence A of question 1 there is a constant difference between consecutive terms, as shown below. Sequence A: 4 7 10 13 16 Difference: + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 In sequence B of question 1 there is a constant ratio between consecutive terms, as shown below. Sequence B: 5 10 20 40 80 Ratio: × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 In sequence C of question 1 there is neither a constant difference nor a constant ratio between consecutive terms. There is, however,a pattern in the differences between the terms, which makes it possible to extend the sequence. Consecutive odd numbers, starting with 3, are added to form the next term. Sequence C: 2 5 10 17 26 Difference: + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 2. Write down the next five terms in each of the sequences below. In each case, describe the relationship between consecutive terms. (a) 100; 95; 90;85; ... (b) 0,3; 0,5; 0,7; 0,9; ... (c) 6; 18; 54; 162; ... (d) 1; 3; 6; 10; 15; ... (e) 20; 31; 42; 53; ... (f) 10; 9,7; 9,4; 9,1;... 1 (g) 18 000; 1 800; 180; 18; ... (h) 1 1 ; ; 1 ; ; ... 48 24 12 6 (i) 1; 4; 9; 16; ... (j) 625; 125; 25; 5;... In all of the above cases it was possible to extend the sequence by repeatedly adding or subtracting a number to get the next term, or by repeatedly multiplying or dividing by a number to get the next term, or by adding different numbers according to some pattern to get the next term. relationships between dependent and independent variables 1. (a) Mr Twala pays a fee to park his car in a parking lot every day. He has to pay R3 to enter the parking lot and then a further R2 for every hour that he leaves his car there. Copy and complete the table on the following page to show how much his parking costs him per day for various numbers of hours. 160 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 3 The word “recur” means “to happen again”. The extension of a number sequence by repeatedly performing the same or similar action is called recursion. The rule that describes the relationship between consecutive terms is called a recursive rule. Number of hours 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Cost of parking in R 5 7 9 (b) How did you complete this table? Describe your method. (c) Is there another way that you could complete the table? Describe it. (d) Thembi multiplied the number of hours by 2 and then added 3 to calculate the cost for any specific number of hours. Copy and complete the flow diagram to show Thembi’s rule. The rule multiply by 2 and then add 3 describes the relationship between the two variables in this situation. The number of hours is the independent variable. The cost of Mr Twala’s parking is the dependent variable because the amount he has to pay depends on the number of hours that he parks. This rule describes how you can calculate the value of the dependent variable if the corresponding value of the independent variable is known. It differs from a recursive rule, which describes how you can calculate the value of the dependent variable that follows on a given value of the dependentvariable. In the case of a number sequence, the position (number) of the term can be taken as the independent variable, as shown for the sequence 15; 19; 23; 27; 31; . . . in this table: Term number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 50 Term 15 19 23 27 31 2. (a) Copy and complete the above table. (b) How did you calculate term number50? (c) Lungile reasoned like this: I added 4 each time to complete the table. I counted backwards to see what comes before term 1. I got 11 and then I knew I had to add one 4 to 11 to get the first term. Complete the pattern below to show Lungile’s thinking: Term 1: 11 + 1 × 4 = 11 + 4 = 15 Term 2: 11 + 2 × 4 = 11 + 8 = 19 Term 3: Term 4: Term 5: Term 6: Term 10: Term 50: 161 CHAPTER 11: NUMERIC ANd GEOMETRIC PATTERNS Lungile remembered that multiplication is done before addition, unless otherwise indicated by brackets. The R3 that is added is a constant in this situation. The number of hours and the cost are variables. (d) Describe in your own words how term number 50 can be calculated. (e) Tilly reasoned like this: The constant difference between the terms is 4. I must add four 49 times to the first term to get the fiftieth term. So, 15 + 49 × 4 = 15 + 196 = 211. Complete the pattern below to demonstrate Tilly’s thinking: Term 1: 15 Term 2: 15 + 1 × 4 = 15 + 4 =19 Term 3: 15 + 2 × 4 = 15 + 8 = 23 Term 4: Term 5: Term 6: Term 10: Term 50: (f) Write the rule to calculate term number 50 in your own words. In the example in question 2, the term number is the independent variable and the term itself is the dependent variable. So, if we know the rule that links the dependent variable and the independent variable, we can use it to determine any term for which we know the term number. 3. Write a rule to calculate the term for any term number in the sequence 15; 19; 23; 27; 31; . . . by using: (a) Lungile’s thinking (b) Tilly’s thinking We can use n as a symbol for “any term number”. The rule to calculate the term for any term number when using Lungile’s thinking will then be: Term = n × 4 + 11 (c) Write down the rule to calculate the term for any term number in terms of n by using Tilly’s thinking. 11.2 Geometric patterns constant quantities and variable quantities Small yellow, blue and red tiles are combined to form larger square tiles as shown below: Tile no. 1 Tile no. 2 Tile no. 3 Tile no. 4 1.

How many yellow tiles are there in each bigger tile? 5. Some of the quantities in this situation are variables and some are constants. Which are variables and which are constants? 6. Was it possible to predict the pattern on tile no. 2 by looking only at tile no. 1? The number of red tiles is constant and the number of blue tiles is constant. It is clear that the design is such that there is always a red tile in the top right corner, and also in the bottom left corner, and that the red tiles are always “bordered” by two blue tiles each. So the number of red and blue tiles is constant in this situation. The number of yellow tiles in the arrangements varies. The number of yellow tiles is a variable in this situation. patterns with matches 1. A pattern with matches is shown below. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 (a) Explain how the pattern is formed.

(c) Nombuso played around with the differences between consecutive terms. She noticed that the pattern (+ 3; + 5; + 7; ...) was similar to the one that you get when you calculate the differences between square numbers. This made her think that she should investigate square numbers to help her find a rule that could link the figure number and the number of squares. Complete the following pattern along the lines of Nombuso’s thinking: Figure 1: 1 × 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 Figure 2: 2 × 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 Figure 3: Figure 4: Figure 5: Figure 6: Figure 7: Figure 8: Figure 50: (d) Write a rule to calculate the number of squares for any figure number.

The number 2 in the rule 2 × n remains the same all the time. We say it is a constant. The letter symbol n represents the number of circles per row and that is a variable, because it changes. + 4 × 5 Consider the sequence 1; 3; 5; 7; 9; ...

In the questions above we have used the letter symbol n to represent: • a changing number in the rule 2 × n (n represents the number of circles in a row) • the position of the odd number in a sequence in the rule 2 × n − 1. 4.

Write out and place a tick mark (✓) next to the correct answer. A. Multiply the input number by5 and then add 4. B. Add 45 to the input number. C. Add 4 to the input number and then multiply by 5. 5. Use 10 as the input number and calculate the output number for each of the word formulae in question 4(b). 175 CHAPTER 13: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 1 + 4 × 5 We call the numbers on the left in the flow diagram the input numbers. The numbers on the right in the flow diagram, and whose values depend on the input numbers, are called the output numbers. The rule 2 × n can be used to calculate the total number of circles in a diagram if the number of circles per row is known. The rule 2 × n − 1 can be used to determine any odd number in the sequence of odd numbers if its position is known. The numbers 2 and −1 remain the same all the time; we call them constants. The numbers in blue change according to the position of the odd number in the sequence. We call them variables. We may write (x + 4) × 5 as an abbreviation for add 4 to the input number, then multiply by 5. (x + 4) × 5 can be called a computational instruction or an algebraic expression. In the expression (x + 4) × 5, the letter symbol x can be replaced by many different input numbers. The symbol x represents a variable quantity or a variable. If, however, the expression (x + 4) × 5 is equal to 35, as in the number sentence (x + 4) × 5 = 35, the symbol x represents only one value, and that is 3. In the expression (x + 4) × 5, the numbers 4 and 5 are constants. In the number sentence (x + 4) × 5 = 35, x is an unknown value. 6. Write the abbreviations for the following computational instructions by using x for “the input number”: (a) Halve the input number and plus 2. (b) Multiply the input number by 6 and subtract 2. (c) Multiply the sum of the input number and 3 by 10. (d) Subtract 4 from the input number and multiply the answer by 7. 7. Cardo’s teacher writes on the board: “Add 2 and then multiply the answer by 3.” The class must use 5 as an input number and apply the computational instruction. (a) Cardo uses 5 as the input number and writes: (5 + 2) × 3. Paul says (5 + 2) × 3 is 7 × 3 which is 21. Is Paul right? (b) Explain your answer in (a). (c) Represent this flow diagram as an algebraic expression: x 8.

Number puzzles like those above can be shortened by using letter symbols as placeholders for unknown numbers. In the case of question 1 we can write the following number sentence: x + 3 = 13. In the case of a number sentence such as x + 3 = 13 we cannot say whether it is true or false until we have determined the value of the unknown. The value of the unknown that makes the number sentence (an equation) true is called the solution of the number sentence. For the number sentence x + 3 = 13, the solution is x = 10 because it makes the number sentence true. the solution is there to see The solution to the number sentence x + 4 = 20 can be seen at once. The value of x is 16 simply because 16 + 4 = 20. In this case, we say we solve the number sentence by inspection. CHAPTER 14: ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 1 179 To make a number sentence true means to find its solution. A mathematical statement such as x + 3 = 13 that could be true or false depending on the value of x, is called an open number sentence or an equation. Solve these number sentences (equations) by inspection. 1. (a) x − 8 = 8 (b) x + 7 = 20 (c) (e) 16 = 8 x 5 × x = 40 (d) (f) x = 2 16 8 × x = 40 2.

Look at the following number puzzle or equation, for example: I am thinking of a number. 6 × the number − 11 = 43. What is the number? In this case, you will have to try many different possible solutions until you identify the correct one. Here we can use a method known as trial and improvement to determine the solution.

Describe briefly how the shape of the bar graphs differ. 5. Turn back to the tables of values that you made for the four relationships in questions 1 and 2. Find out how the output values changed by calculating the differences between consecutive output values,anddescribe the differences for each case as suggested: (a) Sally’s savings: 4 8 12 16 4 4 Sally’s savings grow by every week. (b) Chocolates per friend: 24 12 8 12 The number of chocolates per friend (c) Vusi’s payment per bag: 1 2 1 The amount grows slowly at first and then (d) Areas of Judy’s squares: 1 4 9 3 The area of the squares The amount of money that Sally saves per week stays constant. The relationship therefore has a constant rate of change. With every additional friend, the number of chocolates per friend changes. The number of chocolates changes (decreases) rapidly at first and then it changes slower. The rate of change is not constant. The amount that Vusi would like to earn per bag of acorns grows faster and faster with each bag that he collects. The rate of change increases. The area of a square also increases faster and faster for every centimetre added to the side length. 6. Refer to the bar graphs in questions 1 and 2 and link the shape of the graphs to the rate of change of the relationship. 186 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 3 The shape of a bar graph shows the rate of change of the relationship. If the rate of change is constant, the shape is a straight line. If it is changing, the shape is a curve. The rate of change means how fast or slow change happens per unit of time. 15.3 Interpreting graphs reading graphs 1. Look carefully at the graph. (a) What does this graph tell you?

Consider the following situations: Ben saves R5 per week. Sally saves R7 per week. Charlie saves R5 in the first week, R6 in the second week and R7 in the third week. Every week he increases the amount that he saves by R1. (a) The graph shows Ben’s savings. Copy the graph and draw Sally’s savings and Charlie’s savings. Do it on the same graph. (b) Describe and explain the shape of the graphs showing Sally, Ben and Charlie’s savings. The rate of change in a relationship influences the steepness of the graph. The higher the rate of change (i.e. the faster the output numbers change), the steeper the graph. 2. Examine the following relationships. Copy and complete the tables and calculate the differences between the output numbers indicated with arrows. (a) Christine wants to buy a book for her favourite teacher. The book costs R240. This is a lot of money for Christine to spend. She realises that if she asks her friend Beatrice to share the cost, she will only have to spend R120. She could even ask more classmates to join in and share the cost. Christine investigates the situation and calculates what amount everyone must pay if they share the cost equally.

The change can be: • an increase or a decrease • a constant increase, for example the perimeter of a square as the side length increases • a constant decrease, for example the length of a burning candle • an increase that is not constant but happens faster and faster, for example the area of a square as the side length increases • a decrease that is not constant but happens faster and faster, for example the amount of money each friend has to pay as more and more friends share the cost. CHAPTER 15: GRAPHS 189 In the case of an increase, the graph slopes like this: or or In the case of a decrease, the graph slopes like this: or or When the increase or decrease is constant, the graph is a straight line and it is called a linear graph. If the increase or decrease is not constant, the graph is curved and is called a non-linear graph. If there is no change in the output variable, the graph is a straight horizontal line. 4.

In the diagrams below, the red dotted lines divide the arrows into two parts. In which diagram does the red dotted line divide the arrow into two parts that are exactly the same? Arrow A Arrow B If you were to cut out arrow A and fold it along the red dotted line, the two parts would fit perfectly on top of one another (all edges would match). The fold line is called a line of symmetry or an axis of symmetry. A line or axis of symmetry is a line that divides a figure into two parts that have an equal number of sides, and all the corresponding sides and angles are equal. The two parts on either side of the line of symmetry are mirror images of each other. We also say the parts are congruent. A geometric figure can have no line of symmetry, one line of symmetry, or more than one line of symmetry. Chapter 16 Transformation geometry 194 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 3 congruent figures are figures that are the same size and shape. All the sides and angles of the figures match. identifying lines of symmetry 1. (a) Copy each of the figures shown below. Make a tick next to each figure in which the red line is a line of symmetry. (b) In the figures where the red line is not a line of symmetry, draw in a line of symmetry if this is possible. If there is more than one line of symmetry, draw it in too. If a figure doesn’t have any lines of symmetry, write this above the figure. A B C D E F CHAPTER 16: TRANSFORMATION GEOMETRY 195 2.

In each diagram, the dotted line is the axis of symmetry. Copy and complete each figure. A B 196 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 3 C E 16.2 Original figures and their images Figures can be moved around in different ways – they can be shifted, swung around and turned over. When the movement is done, the figure in its new position is called the image of the original figure. Figures can be moved in three ways: through translation, reflection and rotation. These transformations are often referred to as “sliding” (shifting), “flipping” (turning over) and “turning” (swinging) respectively. 16.3 Translating figures Here are two original figures and their images after the figures were translated: J J' G E ri in l F K L K' L' D' G' Or igi nal I ma e E' Im ag F' When we name the image, we use the same letters for the points that correspond to those of the original figure, but we add the prime symbol ( ' ) after each letter. The image of ∆JKL is ∆J'K'L'. The image of parallelogram DEFG is parallelogram D'E'F'G'. investigating the properties of translation In a translation, all the points on the figure move in the same direction by the same distance. For example, look at ∆JKL above. All of its points have moved six units to the right. Also look at parallelogram DEFG above. All of its points have moved three units to the right and five units down. 1. Look at ∆ABC on the following page. (a) Copy the triangle on the following page. Translate each of the points A, B and C five units to the right and two units down. Then join the translated points to form the image ∆A'B'C'.

(c) Is the area of the original triangle the same as the area of its image? 2. Look at ∆PQR below. (a) On grid paper, copy the triangle below. Translate each of the points P, Q and R four units to the right and two units up. Then join the translated points to form the image ∆P'Q'R'. (b) Join point P and its image, point Q and its image, and point R and its image. (c) Are the line segments that join the original points to their image points equal in length? (d) Are the line segments that join the original points to their image points parallel?

The original and its image are therefore congruent. practise translating figures 1. On grid paper, copy the figure. Translate the figure eight units to the left and two units down. 2.

Describe the translation in each of the following diagrams: (a) (b) (c) 16.4 Reflecting figures When a figure is reflected, it is flipped or turned over. The image that is produced is the mirror image of the original figure. The line of reflection is like a mirror in which the original figure is reflected. The image is produced on the opposite side of the line of reflection. Each point on the original figure and its corresponding point on the image are the same distance away from the line of reflection. investigating the properties of reflection The diagrams on the next page show examples of figures that have been correctly and incorrectly reflected in the lines of reflection.

Properties of reflection The diagram on the right shows ∆FHG and its reflection ∆F'H'G'. Notice the following properties of reflection: • The image of ∆FHG lies on the opposite side of the line of reflection. • The distance from the original point to the line of reflection is the same as the distance from the reflected point to the line of reflection: GE = G'E; FC = F'C and HD = H'D 202 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 3 H' F' e ma D C H G' E inal rig G F on ecti refl of in • The line that connects an original point to its image is always perpendicular (⊥) to the line of reflection: HH' ⊥ line of reflection; FF' ⊥ line of reflection, and GG' ⊥line of reflection. • When a figure is reflected, its shape and size do not change. The original and its image are therefore congruent. practise reflecting figures 1. Copy the figures below and reflect the figures in the given line of reflection.

This point is called the centre of rotation and could be inside the figure or outside of the figure.

(d) Measure the size of the angle RAR'. What do you notice? 4. In any of the diagrams in questions 1 to 3 above, measure the sides of the original triangle and the corresponding sides of the image. What do you notice? Properties of rotation • The distance from the centre of rotation to any point on the original is equal to the distance from the centre of rotation to the corresponding point on the image. In the diagram on the right: PA = PA', PB = PB' and PC = PC'. • The angle formed by the connecting lines between any point on the original figure, the centre of rotation and the corresponding point on the image is equal to the angle of rotation. For example, if the image is rotated through 90°, this angle will be equal to 90°. If the image is rotated through 45°, the angle will be 45°. • When a figure is rotated, its shape and size do not change.

Reducing a figure means that we make it smaller in a specific way. Enlarging or reducing figures is also called resizing. investigate the properties of enlargements and reductions 1. Look at the following rectangles and answer the questions below. J M D B G L (a) Rectangle EFGH: How many times is FG longer than BC? How many times is EF longer than AB? (b) Rectangle JKLM: How many times is KL longer than BC? How many times is JK longer than AB? When the lengths of all the sides of a figure are multiplied by the same number to produce a second figure, the second figure is an enlargement or reduction of the first figure. The number by which the sides are multiplied to produce an enlargement or reduction is called the scale factor. The scale factor in question 1(b) above is 2. We say that figure ABCD has been enlarged (or resized) by a scale factor of 2 to produce figure JKLM. Figure EFGH is not an enlargement of figure ABCD because not all its sides have been increased by the same scale factor. CHAPTER 16: TRANSFORMATION GEOMETRY 209 2 The scale factor • When the scale factor is 1, the image is the same size as the original. • When the scale factor is <1, the image is a reduction. For example, if the scale factor is 1 or 0,5, each side of the image is half the length of its corresponding side in the original figure. • When the scale factor is >1, the image is an enlargement. For example, if the scale factor is 2, each side of the image is double the length of its corresponding side in the original figure. 2. Look at the following triangles and answer the questions that follow. (a) How many times is: • FG longer than BC? • JK shorter than BC? • EF longer than AB? • IJ shorter than AB? • EG longer than AC? • IK shorter than AC? (b) Is ∆EFG an enlargement of ∆ABC? Explain your answer. (c) Is ∆IJK a reduction of ∆ABC? Explain your answer. Similar figures When figures are enlarged or reduced, the enlarged or reduced image is similar to the original figure. ∆ABC, ∆EFG and ∆IJK above are all similar. We also say that the lengths of their corresponding sides are in proportion.

Spheres (balls), cylinders and cones are examples of objects with curved surfaces. Objects with only flat surfaces are called polyhedra. Examples of objects with curved surfaces Examples of objects with flat surfaces only what is a polyhedron? A polyhedron is a three-dimensional object (or 3D object) made of flat surfaces only. It has no curved surfaces. It consists of faces, edges and vertices. A face is the flat surface of a 3D object. An edge is the segment where two faces of a polyhedron intersect. A vertex is the point where the edges meet. 213 CHAPTER 17: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS We say: one polyhedron; two or more polyhedra. We say: one vertex; two or more vertices.

Prisms A prism is a polyhedron with two faces that are congruent and parallel polygons. These faces are called bases and they are connected by lateral faces that are parallelograms. In the case of right prisms the bases are connected by rectangles which are perpendicular to the base and the top. This means the lateral faces of a right prism make a 90° angle with the bases. A prism is named according to the shape of its base. So a prism whose base is a triangle is called a triangular prism; a prism whose base is a rectangle or square is called a rectangular prism; and a prism with a pentagonal base is called a pentagonal prism. Any pair of faces in a prism that are congruent and parallel can be the bases of that prism. A cube is a special type of prism. It has six congruent faces; therefore any of its faces can be a base. Triangular prism Rectangular prism Pentagonal prism Cube 215 CHAPTER 17: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS congruent means exactly the same shape and size. lateral faces are faces that aren’t bases. These are two oblique prisms – the one on the left is a triangular prism and the one on the right is an oblique pentagonal prism. Pyramids A pyramid has only one base. The lateral faces of a pyramid are always triangles. These triangles meet at the same vertex at the top. This vertex is called the apex of the pyramid. In a right pyramid, the lateral faces are isosceles triangles. There are many types of pyramids. The type of pyramid is determined by the shape of its base. For example, a triangular-based pyramid has a triangle as its base, a square-based pyramid has a square as its base and a hexagonal-based pyramid has a hexagon as its base. apex Square-based pyramid It has five faces: one square, four triangles Hexagonal-based pyramid It has seven faces: one hexagon, six triangles If a pyramid is not a right pyramid, it is called an oblique pyramid, like the two shown below. The lateral faces of an oblique pyramid are not necessarily isosceles triangles. 216 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 3 A triangular-based pyramid is also called a triangular pyramid; a square-based pyramid is also called a square pyramid; a hexagonal-based pyramid is also called a hexagonal pyramid, etc. identifying prisms and pyramids 1.

Different 3D objects have different nets. Sometimes the same 3D object can have different nets. Here are examples of different 3D objects and their nets. Triangular pyramid Rectangular prism Cube In this section, you are going to focus on the net of a cube. In order for a net to form a cube, it must consist of six equal squares. But not all net patterns that consist of six squares will fold into a cube. Only one of the nets below will fold into a cube. Write down which one it is. A B C D 220 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 3 R a cube or not a cube In order to decide whether or not a net will fold into a cube, you have to imagine what will happen when you fold the net. Read through the following steps. 1. We can label the faces of a cube: bottom face (X), right face (R), back face (B), left face (L), top face (T) and front face (F). We will use these terms in the rest of the steps. 2. Start by choosing one square of the net as the bottom face (marked with an X). 3. Look at the square to the right of the X. (It is coloured blue.) If you fold the net on the red line, the blue square will be the right face of the cube. 4. Look at the next square to the left of the right face. If you fold this square on the red line, it will become the front face of the cube. fold R B L T F fold 221 CHAPTER 17: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS R F 5. Look at the square to the left of the front face. It will fold to become the left face of the cube. 6. The square to the left of the left face of the cube will become the back face of the cube. 7. The last square will form the top. fold 8.

We use numbers to say how many objects there are in a collection, for example the number of desks in a classroom. For this purpose we use the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . Numbers are also used to describe size, for example the lengths of objects. For this purpose we need more than the counting numbers, wealso need fractions.Another purpose ofnumbers is toindicate position, for example theposition ofthe right end of theredline on the pictures below. Numbers also occur as the solutions to equations, and the natural numbers and fractions do not provide solutions for all equations. For example, there is no natural number or fraction that is the solution to the equation 10 − x = 20. The number that provides the solution to this equation must have the property that when you subtract it, it has the same effect as when you add 10! With a view to have numbers that can serve more purposes than counting and measuring, mathematicians have decided to also think of another kind of numbers which are called integers. The integers include the natural numbers, but for each natural number, for example 24, there is also another number called the additive inverse. For example, −24 is the additive inverse of 24. When you add a number to its additive inverse, the answer is 0. For example, 24 + (−24) = 0. saying how cold it is One of the uses of integers is for the measurement of temperature. If we say that the temperature is 0 when water freezes to become ice, we need numbers smaller than 0 to describe the temperature when it gets even colder than when water freezes. When water starts boiling, its temperature is 100 degrees on the scale called the Celsius scale. Liquids expand when heated, and shrink when cooled down. So when it is warm, the liquid in a thin tube may almost fill the tube: When it is cold, the column of liquid will be quite short. CHAPTER 18: INTEGERS 227 This property of liquid is used to measure temperature, and an instrument like the one shown on the previous page is called a thermometer. This is what a thermometer will show when it is put in water that is boiling. It shows a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, which is written as 100 °C. –80 –60 –40 –20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 On the diagram below, you can see what a thermometer will show if it is in water that is starting to freeze.

When he turned 10, his grandmother gave him R100. He also opened his savings tin on his tenth birthday and there was R260 in the tin. Simon was very happy. He said to himself: “I am very rich!” Simon decides to buy some things that he has always wanted. This is what he decides to buy: • a soccer ball at R160 • a pair of sunglasses at R180 • a book about animals at R90 1.

How much money will Simon have if he buys the soccer ball, the sunglasses and the book about animals? Simon did these calculations while he was thinking about buying the various items: R360 − R160 = R200 R200 − R180 = R20 R20 − R90 = (−) R70 ? CHAPTER 18: INTEGERS 229 6. Fatima owns a small shop. One afternoon when she closed the shop, she had R120 cash, clients owed her R90, and she owed her suppliers R310.In Fatima’s view her financial position was as follows: R120 + R90 − R310 = −R100.

(b) On another day, Fatima ended the business day with R150 cash, clients owed her R130 and she owed her suppliers R460. What was her financial position? About 500 years ago, some mathematicians proposed that a “negative number” may be used to describe the result in a situation like the above, where a number is subtracted from a number smaller than itself. For example, we may say 10 − 20 = (−10) This proposal was soon accepted by other mathematicians, and it is now used all over the world. 7. Copy the table below.

Natural numbers are whole numbers –they do not contain fraction parts. 1. Is there a natural number that can be put in the brackets below to make the statement true? 12 + ( ) = 17 2. In each case below, copy the statement and insert a natural number in the space between the brackets that will make the statement true. (a) 15+ ( ) = 21 (b) 15 − ( ) = 10 (c) ( ) + 10 = 34 (d) ( ) − 10 = 34 (e) 3× ( ) = 18 3.

(a) Can you think of a natural number that will make this statement true? 8 + ( .... ) = 5 (b) Can you think of any other number that will make the statement true? We are looking for a number that will make the following statement true: 8 + ( .... ) = 5 Consider this plan: Let us agree that we will call this number negative 3 and write it as (−3). If we agree to this, we can say 8 + (−3) = 5. This may seem a bit strange to you. You do not have to agree now. But even if you do not agree, let us explore how this plan may work for other numbers. What answers will a person who agrees to the plan give to the following question? 5. Calculate each of the following: (a) 10+ (−3) (b) 12 +(−3) (c) 12+ (−5) (d) 10 +(−9) (e) 8+ (−8) (f) 1 + (−1) 232 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 What may each of the following be equal to? 5 + (−8) (−5) + (−8) We normally think of adding as making something bigger. Question 4(a) requires us to change our mind about this. We have to consider the possibility that adding a number may make something smaller. Here is a different way to ask the same questions: (a) What is x if 15 + x = 21? (b) What is x if 15 − x = 10? (c) What is x if x + 10 = 34? (d) What is x if x − 10 = 34? (e) What is x if 3 × x = 18? You might agree that: 5 + (−5) = 0 10 + (−10) = 0 and 20 + (−20) = 0 We may say that for each “positive” number there is a corresponding or opposite negative number. Two positive and negative numbers that correspond, for example 3 and (−3), are called additive inverses. They wipe each other out when you add them. When you add any number to its additive inverse, the answer is 0. For example, 120 + (−120) = 0 So, the set of integers consists of all the natural numbers and their additive inverses and zero. 6. Write the additive inverse of each of the following numbers: (a) 24 (b) −24 (c) −103 (d) 2 348 The idea of additive inverses may be used to explain why 8 + (−5) is equal to 3: 8 + (−5) = 3 + 5 + (−5) = 3 + 0 = 3 7. Use the idea of additive inverses to explain why each of these statements is true: (a) 43 + (−30)= 13 (b) 150 + (−80) = 70 8. Calculate each of the following: (a) 10 + 4+ (−4) (b) 10 + (−4) + 4 (c) 3 + 8 + (−8) (d) 3 + (−8) + 8 9.

It would make things easy if we agree that this should also be the case for negative numbers. The number zero is regarded as an integer. 11. In each case find the number that makes the statement true. Give your answer by writing a closed number sentence. (a) 20 + (an unknown number) = 50 (b) 50 + (an unknown number) = 20 (c) 20 + (an unknown number) = 10 (d) (an unknown number) + (−25) = 50 (e) (an unknown number) + (−25) = (−50) 12.

Calculate: (a) 80 + (−60) (b) 500 + (−200) + (−200) 2. (a) Do you agree that 20 + (−5) = 15? (b) What do you think 20 − (−5) should be? 3. (a) Is 100 + (−20) + (−20) = 60, or does it equal something else? (b) What do you think (−20) + (−20) should be equal to? 4. Copy and complete the following as far as you can: (a) (b) (c) 5 − 9 = 5 + 9 = 9 − 3 = 5 − 8 = 5 + 8 = 8 − 3 = 5 − 7 = 5 + 7 = 7 − 3 = For how many different pairs of numbers can the following statement be true, if only natural (positive) numbers are allowed? a number + another number = 10 For how many different pairs of numbers can the statement be true if negative numbers are also allowed? 234 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 We normally think of addition and subtraction as actions that have opposite effects: what the one does is the opposite or inverse of what the other does. Statements like these are also called number sentences. An incomplete number sentence, where some numbers are not known at first, is sometimes called an open number sentence, for example: 8 − (a number) = 10. A closed number sentence is where all the numbers are known, for example: 8 + 2 = 10. 5 − 6 = 5 + 6 = 6 − 3 = 5 − 5 = 5 + 5 = 5 − 3 = 5 − 4 = 5 + 4 = 4 − 3 = 5 − 3 = 5 + 3 = 3 − 3 = 5 − 2 = 5 + 2 = 2 − 3 = 5 − 1 = 5 + 1 = 1 − 3 = 5 − 0 = 5 + 0 = 0 − 3 = 5 − (−1) = 5 + (−1) = (−1) − 3 = 5 − (−2) = 5 + (−2) = (−2) − 3 = 5 − (−3) = 5 + (−3) = (−3) − 3 = 5 − (−4) = 5 + (−4) = (−4) − 3 = 5 − (−5) = 5 + (−5) = (−5) − 3 = 5. Calculate each of the following: (a) 20 − 20 (b) 50 − 20 (c) (−20) − (−20) (d) (−50) − (−20) 6. In each case, suggest a number that may make the statement true. Also give an argument to support your proposal. (a) 20 + (a number) = 8 (b) 20 + (a number) = 28 (c) 20 − (a number) = 28 (d) 20 − (a number) = 12 some history The following statement is true if the number is 5: 15 − (a certain number) = 10 A few centuries ago, some mathematicians decided they wanted to have numbers that will also make sentences like the following true: 15 + (a certain number) = 10 But to go from 15 to 10 you have to subtract 5. The number we need to make the sentence 15 + (a certain number) = 10 true must have the following strange property: If you add this number, it should have the same effect as to subtract 5. Now the mathematicians of a few centuries ago really wanted to have numbers for which such strange sentences would be true. So they thought: “Let us just decide, and agree amongst ourselves, that the number we call negative 5 will have the property that if you add it to another number, the effect will be the same as when you subtract the natural number 5.” This means that the mathematicians agreed that 15 + (−5) is equal to 15 − 5. Stated differently, instead of adding negative 5 to a number, you may subtract 5. CHAPTER 18: INTEGERS 235 We may agree that subtracting a negative number has the same effect as adding the additive inverse of the negative number. If we stick to this agreement, the following two calculations should have the same answer: 10 − (−7) and 10 + 7 7. Calculate.

CHAPTER 22: ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 2 257 23.1 Collecting data Think of something that you really want to know about your own community or about children your age in other schools. For example, “How many Grade 7 learners in South Africa have access to a computer?” What would you find interesting to know about? When you start the cycle of data handling, you start with at least one question. But there can of course be many more questions. Once you have a research idea in mind, you can start planning how you will collect the data. When you collect data, you need to consider: • what question you are asking • where you will find the data to answer the question (for example, from people such as your peers, family or the wider community; or from published sources such as newspapers, books or magazines) • how you will collect the data (for example, by using questionnaires or conducting interviews) • who you will collect the data from (the entire population or a sample). populations and samples: from whom to collect data In data handling, population refers to the whole group you are asking the question about. Sample refers to a small number of the group that you think will represent the whole group. Here is an example: Thandeka wants to know about the home languages of all Grade 7s across the whole of South Africa. All Grade 7s in all of South Africa would be the population of that data. But it is not possible to reach every single Grade 7 learner in South Africa, so Thandeka could choose a sample of Grade 7 learners. For example, she could choose to collect data from her own Grade 7 class and from two other Grade 7 classes from two other schools. But if Thandeka chose her own Grade 7 class and only two other classes from other schools, her sample would not really give information about learners across the whole Chapter 23 Collect, organise and summarise data 258 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 of South Africa, because the learners in all three of the schools could be from the same language group. So, how can you try to make sure that a sample gives information about the whole population? In other words, how can you make sure that your sample is representative of the population? 1. Choose a big enough sample. Generally, the bigger the sample is the more likely it is to represent the characteristics of the population. 2. Ensure that you do not take a sample from only one of the groups within the population. For example, if you want to find out if people like watching soccer, you cannot survey people at a Chiefs versus Pirates match. The majority of these people will almost certainly be there because they love watching soccer! Example Ganief wishes to find out if learners at his school like the style and colour of their school uniform and surveys ten learners in Grade 7.There are 2 000 learners at the school. Give two reasons to explain why the sample chosen is not likely to be representative of the population. Answer 1. The sample is too small. 2. He is only getting the views of Grade 7s, not of the learners in any of the other grades (who might have very different views). thinking about populations and samples 1. Here are some research questions. Copy the statements below and use a P to show which statement describes the population and an S to show which statement describes a sample of the population. (a) What percentage of plants in the vegetable patch is affected by disease? All the plants in the vegetable patch Every fourth or fifth plant in the vegetable patch (b) How often do teenagers recycle plastic? Every teenager in South Africa About 40 teenagers in the community (c) How many hours of sleep do 10-year-olds in my community get per night? All 10-year-olds in the community About ten 10-year-olds in the community CHAPTER 23: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 259 2. You want to know the most popular colour of the learners in your school. (a) Write down the population of your data collection. (b) Write down what sample you would use. 3. Census@School took place in 2001 and 2009. These were surveys that Statistics South Africa did to show learners how information about people is collected and analysed. The Census@School wanted to know personal, community and household information about learners from Grades 3 to 12. This is how they chose their sample: • A sample of 2 500 schools was selected from the Department of Basic Education’s database of approximately 26 000 registered schools. • The schools were divided into groups depending on their province, school type (primary: Grades 3 to 7 only; intermediate: Grades 5 to 9 only; secondary: Grades 8 to 12 only; combined: Grades 3 to 12), and education district. • A sample of schools was selected from each of these groups. • Approximately 790 000 learners participated in the Census@School 2009. This information was included in their final report. (a) What percentage was the sample of all the schools in the country? (b) Why do you think they separated the schools into groups first? (c) Do you think the information that they obtained from this survey would be interesting to you? Explain. 4. Unathi goes to River View Girls’ Primary School. She wants to find out whether 13- year-olds in her town prefer rugby or netball. She surveys ten learners from each of the three Grade 7 classes at her school. Is the sample chosen likely to be representative of the population (13-year-olds in her town)? Explain your answer. constructing questionnaires: how to collect data A questionnaire is a sheet with questions used to collect data from people. Each respondent in the sample completes a questionnaire. The questions on the sheet can be structured differently, for example: • The questions may require “yes” or “no” answers. • Aselection ofanswers (multiple-choice answers) may be provided for respondents to choose from. • The respondents may enter their own views or information on the questionnaire. The type of responses you need (for example a simple “yes” or “no” or more detailed information) depends on the data you intend to collect. 260 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 A respondent is a person who fills in a questionnaire or from whom you collect data. Tick the box if you have: Look at the examples below. Notice how each question is worded to be as clear as possible and to allow the data to be collected easily. (The questions in examples 4 and 5 were used by Census@School in their 2009 questionnaire.) Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 Example 4 1 Running water inside your home 6 A cell phone 2 Electricity inside your home 7 Access to a computer 3 A radio at home 8 Access to the internet 4 A TV at home 9 Access to a library 5 A telephone at home Example 5 making questionnaires 1. (a) Refue wants to find out how much pocket money learners in her class receive each month. She draws up the following multiple-choice question: Explain why this question is not clear. Give at least three reasons. No Yes do you help with chores at home? washing clothes making beds cleaning dishes sweeping/vacuuming Which of these chores do you help with? 9–11 years 16–19 years How old are you? 5–8 years 12–15 years Note in example 3 how all the ages from 5 to 19 are covered, but without any overlaps. 6 How tall are you without your shoes on? Answer to the nearest centimetre. centimetres 7 What is the length of your right foot, without a shoe? Answer to the nearest centimetre. centimetres 8 What is your arm span?

You want to find out which sports learners at your school play. (a) Describe the population of your data. (b) Describe the sample you will use. 3. Make a question with yes/no or multiple-choice responses to help you collect the data you need. 4. Collect your data from your population or the sample you chose. Keep your data for the next chapter. 23.2 Organising data To organise data that we have collected, we can use tally marks and tables, dot plots, and stem-and-leaf displays. We can also group the data when there are many data values. The ways that we organise the data depends on the type of data we collected. different types of data Look at the five examples of questions for questionnaires on page 261. 1. Which of the examples will give you data that looks like this? Yes 1 235 learners No 1 265 learners 2. Which of the examples might give you data that looks like this? 132 cm; 141 cm; 160 cm; 132 cm; 154 cm; 145 cm; 147 cm; 129 cm; 121 cm; 143 cm; 135 cm; 154 cm; 156 cm; 133 cm; 156 cm; 123 cm; 137 cm etc. 3. What could the data for example 4 look like? Copy and fill in this table to give a possible example for 30 learners. Use numbers that you have made up. Number of learners 262 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 4. Which of the examples might give you a data set that looks like this? 5–8 years 15 9–11 years 45 12–15 years 32 16–19 years 28 The type of data in questions 1 and 3 is called categorical data. This is often described by words. The categories don’t have to be given in order. The type of data in questions 2 and 4 is called numerical data. Numerical data can be whole numbers only, or it can include fractions. For both of these kinds of data, your results give you a list of responses. You will soon learn how to organise these responses. 5. Classify the following data sets as categorical or numerical. (a) the number of pages in books (b) the length of learners’ arm spans (c) learners’ favourite soccer teams (d) the time it takes 13-year-olds to run 1,5 km (e) the cost of different types ofcell phones (f) colours of new cars manufactured organising categorical data Thandeka asked the following question: “Which of South Africa’s official languages are the home languages of the learners in my class?” Thandeka drew up a table with each learner’s name. She then asked each learner what his or her home language was, and wrote it down as follows: Name Language Name Language Name Language Nonkhanyiso isiXhosa Marike Afrikaans Herbert Sepedi Anna Afrikaans Jennifer Sepedi Thabo isiXhosa Mpho Ndebele Nomonde isiXhosa Nomi isiXhosa Nontobeko isiZulu Thandeka Sepedi Manare Sepedi Jonathan English Siza isiZulu Unathi Sesotho Sibongile isiZulu Prince Sesotho Gabriel Ndebele Dumisani isiZulu Duma isiZulu Marlene Afrikaans Matshediso Sesotho Thandile Sepedi Simon Sesotho CHAPTER 23: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 263 Name Language Name Language Name Language Chokocha Sepedi Nicholas Sesotho Miriam Setswana Khanyisile isiXhosa Jabulani isiZulu Sibusiso isiZulu Ramphamba Tshivenda Nomhle isiXhosa Mishack isiZulu Portia isiZulu Frederik Afrikaans Peter Setswana Erik Afrikaans Lola Afrikaans Maya Afrikaans Jan Afrikaans Zinzi isiXhosa Thobile Sesotho Palesa isiZulu Jacob Setswana We don’t need the learners’ names in the data. This data could be written as a list of the languages, like this: Now work with this data set to see what story it is telling you. What do you notice about the data? 1. What do you need to find out from this list of languages? 2. Does it matter what order you write the languages in? Why or why not? 3. (a) Copy Thandeka’s graph below. Place a dot above each language to show every learner who speaks that language. The languages are in alphabetical order. Try to space out the dots evenly. The dots for Afrikaans have been drawn for you. A graph like this is called a dot plot.

(c) List the languages in order from the language spoken by the most learners to the language spoken by the fewest learners. You can also record results in a tally table. To do this, you draw a single line ( | ) for each item you count. This line is called a tally mark. You group tally marks in groups of five. The fifth tally mark is always drawn horizontally to show that the group of five is complete. Then you start a new group. This makes it easy to quickly count how many tally marks there are in a particular category. 4. (a) Copy and complete the table. Home language of learners in the Grade 7 class Language Number of speakers of each home language Total Afrikaans |||| ||| 8 English | 1 isiXhosa isiZulu Ndebele Sepedi Sesotho Setswana Siswati Tshivenda Xitsonga Total (whole class) (b) How many learners altogether were asked about their home language? (c) Which home language occurs most often in this class? (d) Which languages are not spoken as a home language by any of the learners in this class? (e) Write a short paragraph to describe the home languages in Thandeka’s class. Dot plots and tally tables are used for numerical data too. You can write data values on prepared tally tables or dot plots as you record them. This sorts the data at the same time as it is recorded. CHAPTER 23: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 265 Examples of tally marks: A count of three = ||| A count of four = |||| A count of five = |||| A count of seven = |||| || introducing stem-and-leaf displays A stem-and-leaf display (also called a stem- and-leaf plot) is a way of listing numerical data using two columns divided by a vertical line. Each number is split across thecolumns. For example, if the numbers in a set of data consist of digits for tens and units (such as 23, 25 and 34), the column on the right (the leaf column) shows the units digits of the numbers, and the column on the left (the stem column) shows the tens digits of the numbers. Example 1 Show the following data set as a stem-and-leaf display: 13, 56, 20, 35, 47, 53, 12, 51, 53, 49, 34, 53 First, we order the values in the data set from smallest to biggest: 12, 13, 20, 34, 35, 47, 49, 51, 53, 53, 53, 56 The stem-and-leaf display of the above data set looks like this: Stems Leaves Key: 1 | 2 means 12 Values with the same stem are written in the same row. Numbers with the same tens value are separated by a space or a comma. The first row shows the numbers 12 and 13, the second row shows 20, and the last row shows 51, 53, 53, 53 and 56. In this example, the stem column shows the tens digit of each value. Here the leaf column shows the units digit of each value. Example 2 The stem-and-leaf display on the following page shows the units digits as the leaves, and both the hundreds and tens digits as the stems: 266 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 In this example, the tens digits range from one to five, so we list these in the stem column. Then we fill in the units digits in theleaf column. Numerical data is data that consists of numbers. 1 2, 3 2 0 3 4, 5 4 7, 9 5 1, 3, 3, 3, 6 Key: 10 | 2 means 102 The values shown are: 102, 105, 110, 116, 121, 124, 124, 147, 149, 161, 163, 168. Note that if there is a 0 in the leaf column it means the unit digit is a 0, as in 110 above. When there is nothing written in the leaf column next to a stem, it means that there aren’t any numbers with that particular stem. In the case of stem 13 above, for example, it means there are no values between 129 and 140. When you draw stem-and-leaf displays, it is important that the numbers line up vertically so that you can compare the leaves. Draw lines to help you. (Or use grid paper, if you have some.) dot plots and stem-and-leaf displays 1. Look at the following stem-and-leaf display and answer the questions below.

For example, the following data set shows the number of milk bottles collected by 24 learners for recycling: 9, 10, 13, 23, 24, 26, 26, 27, 30, 31, 34, 40, 42, 49, 50, 53, 61, 64, 67, 67, 68, 69, 91, 94 We can group the data into categories called class intervals, such as 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, and so on. We can then count how many times a value occurs in each interval. The number of times a value occurs in an interval is called its frequency. This table shows the grouped data and the frequency of the values in each interval. Interval 0–9 10–19 20–29 30–39 40–49 50–59 60–69 70–79 80–89 90–99 Frequency 1 2 5 3 3 2 6 0 0 2 The tableshowsthat one learner collected0–9 bottles,twolearners collected 10–19bottles, five learners collected 20–29 bottles, and so on.

People want to know what your conclusions are, without looking at all of the data you have collected. It is often useful to summarise a set of numerical data by using one value. For example, which value best summarises or describes the following data set? 0 1 1 5 8 8 9 9 10 10 10 11 11 Statisticians use any of three values that show the most central values in the set, or the value around which the other values tend to cluster. These values are called the measures of central tendency or summary statistics. 270 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 Statisticians are mathematicians who specialise in collecting, organising and analysing data. This activity will help you to understand how the mean represents the whole set of data. Make piles of blocks of different heights: Then move blocks from the higher piles to the lower ones to make all the piles equal: You have just found the mean: Each pile now has four blocks in it. But how do you do this if you only have the numbers 5, 6, 3, 2 and 4 to work with? You add them up and then divide the answer by the total number of values (numbers): 5 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 20 20 ÷ 5 = 4 What this means is that you are finding a single number that you can use in place of all the different numbers and still get the same total. • The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the data set. In the example on the previous page, the mode is 10 because it occurs the most times (three times). • The median is the value exactly in the middle of the data set when the data values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. For the data set on the previous page, the median is 9 because there are six values to the right of the first 9 and six values to the left of it. • The mean (average) is the total (sum) of the values divided by the number of values in the data set. So: Mean = Total of values = 93 = 7,15 Number of values 13 understanding the mean CHAPTER 23: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 271 In the data set on the previous page, either 10 (mode), 9 (median) or 7,15 (mean) could be used to represent the entire data set. If the data set consists of an even number of items, the median = sum of the two middle values divided by 2. A data set can have more than one mode. It is also useful to know how big the spread of the data is. The range of a data set is the difference between the highest value and the lowest value. For example, for the data set on the previous page, the range is: 11 − 0 = 11 The bigger the range, the more the data is spread out. The smaller the range, the more the data is clustered around similar values. determining the mode, median, mean and range 1.

Remember when you drew dot plots in the previous chapter, you could see which categories or measurements occurred many times and which occurred only a few times. There are a few different graphs that show the important things about the data in such a way that you can see them easily. You need to be able to draw these graphs. 24.1 Bar graphs and double bar graphs drawing a bar graph A bar graph shows categories (or classes) of data along the horizontal axis, and the frequency of each category along the vertical axis. (Sometimes the axes are swopped around.) Here is an example of a bar graph.

Mr Makae wants to buy an orange farm. Three farms are available, each with an orchard of orange trees, and the three farms cost about the same. There are 40 orange trees on each farm. The total mass of oranges (in kilograms) harvested from each tree on each farm over the last three years is given below. Which farm should he buy? Farm A: 426 628 467 413 862 585 652 600 734 611 741 605 536 643 833 438 613 704 623 719 719 701 501 768 642 444 751 579 695 726 616 619 441 703 902 947 785 952 725 721 Farm B: 822 736 773 674 884 463 644 433 688 487 884 530 448 410 982 638 492 638 725 621 743 661 744 530 560 745 455 943 760 734 888 457 621 969 507 500 542 831 576 801 Farm C: 438 530 743 947 450 777 859 748 473 724 750 852 428 464 725 554 758 997 467 743 722 438 779 690 785 543 752 898 474 483 460 772 544 756 491 576 482 744 701 803 CHAPTER 24: REPRESENT dATA 277 2. How can the data about the orange trees on the three farms be organised so that the farmer has a clear picture of the difference between the orchards on the three farms? For now, just write down how you think the data may be organised. You will organise the data later when you do the questions that follow. 3. Copy and complete these tally and frequency tables for the data about the masses of oranges harvested on the three orange farms. Masses of oranges harvested from different trees on Farm A Mass of oranges harvested from each tree. These are called class intervals. Number of trees that produced masses in the interval Total 400 kg or more but less than 500 kg |||| | 500 kg or more but less than 600 kg |||| 600 kg or more but less than 700 kg |||| |||| || 700 kg or more but less than 800 kg |||| |||| ||| Masses of oranges harvested from different trees on Farm B Class interval Number of trees that produced masses in the interval Total 400 kg or more but less than 500 kg |||| ||| 8 500 kg or more but less than 600 kg |||| || 7 600 kg or more but less than 700 kg |||| ||| 700 kg or more but less than 800 kg |||| ||| 800 kg or more but less than 900 kg 900 kg or more but less than 1 000 kg Masses of oranges harvested from different trees on Farm C Class interval Number of trees that produced masses in the interval Total 400 kg or more but less than 500 kg 700 kg or more but less than 800 kg On the next page, you will learn how to draw graphs of the data for the three farms. The data for Farm A is represented on the following graph. 278 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 Histogram of the total masses of oranges from trees on Farm A 20 15 10 5 0 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 Mass intervals This type of graph is called a histogram. (The columns in a histogram are normally not coloured differently, or even coloured at all. In this histogram the columns are coloured only because some questions are asked about them in question 4 below.) The numbers 400 on the left and 500 on the right of the light yellow column indicate that masses of 400 kg or more but less than 500 kg are counted in that interval. The height of each column represents the number of masses (the frequency) that fall in that interval. 4. (a) A total of 536 kg of oranges was harvested from one of the trees on Farm A over a period of the three years. In which column on the above histogram is this tree represented? Explain your answer. (b) Which masses are represented in the red column? (c) Which class interval is represented by the light blue column on the above histogram? (d) How many masses are represented by the green column? (e) Which column represents the highest frequency? 5. Copy and complete the following histograms.

For example, we can group heights into class intervals of 10 cm, as shown below: Height (m) Heights that fall in the class interval Frequency 1,20–1,30 1,20; 1,25; 1,29 3 1,30–1,40 1,30; 1,31; 1,35; 1,39 4 1,40–1,50 1,40; 1,46; 1,48; 1,48; 1,49 5 1,50–1,60 1,53; 1,53; 1,57; 1,58; 1,59; 1,59 6 We follow the convention that the top value (also called the upper boundary) of each class interval is not included in the interval. interpreting a histogram Study the histogram (on page 281) showing the numbers of members, in different age groups, of a sports club. Then answer the questions that follow. 1. Complete a frequency table for the information. 2. How many of the members are in their fifties? 3. How many members does the club have? 4. When you drew a bar graph, it did not matter what order the bars were in. Does the order of the columns on the histogram matter? Explain. 280 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 So the height of 1,20 m falls into the 1,20–1,30 m interval, but the height 1,30 m falls into the 1,30–1,40 m interval. Frequency Frequency 0 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Ages of members (years) Notice that you cannot see the individual data values in a histogram – they have been “lost”.

Bigger categories of data have bigger slices of the circle. Look at the example of a pie chart below. Number of learners playing sports Soccer 100 Hockey Basketball Cricket Categories of data The pie chart shows the following: • A total of 200 learners were asked about the sports they played: 20 + 30 + 50 + 100 = 200 • The key shows the four categories of data: – soccer – hockey – basketball – cricket. • 100 of the 200 learners play hockey. This is the largest category, and gets the biggest slice (half of the whole). • 20 of the 200 learners play basketball. This is the smallest category, and gets the smallest slice (one tenth of the whole). You will learn how to draw accurate pie charts in later grades. In this grade, you will estimate the portions of a pie chart that each category of data requires. 284 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 30 50 20 Halve each slice Halve each slice 1 2 estimating sizes of slices in a pie chart 1.

To do the experiment you need a bag like a plastic shopping bag or a brown paper bag. You also need three objects of the same size and shape, like three buttons, bottle tops or small square pieces of cardboard. The three objects must look different, for example they should have different colours such as yellow, red and blue. If you use cardboard squares, you can write “yellow”, “red” and “blue” on them. 1. (a) Put your three objects in your bag. You will later draw one object out of the bag, without looking inside. Can you say whether the object that you will draw will be the yellow one, the blue one or the red one? (b) Discuss this with two classmates. 2. (a) Now draw an object out of the bag, write down its colour, and put it back. (b) You will soon do this 12 times. Can you say how many times you will draw each of the three colours? If you think you can, write down your prediction. (c) Compare your predictions with two classmates. (d) Can you think of any reason why you may draw blue more often than red or yellow, when you do the experiment described in (b)? 3. (a) Draw an object out of the bag, write down its colour, and put it back. Do this 12 times and write down the colour of the object each time. (b) Write your results in a table like the one below. Outcome Yellow Red Blue Number of times obtained What you did in question 3 is called a probability experiment. Each time you drew an object out of the bag, you performed a trial. Each time you performed a trial, three different things could have happened. These are called the possible outcomes. Chapter 26 Probability 294 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 Each time you performed a trial, one of the possible outcomes actually occurred. This is called the actual outcome. The number of times that a specific outcome occurred during an experiment is called the actual frequency of that outcome. 4. (a) What were the possible outcomes in the experiment that you did in question 3? (b) How many trials did you perform in the experiment? (c) What was the actual outcome in the third trial that you performed? (d) What was the actual frequency of drawing a blue object during the 12 trials in the experiment that you did? 26.2 Relative frequencies Thomas also did the experiment in question 3 on page 294 but he performed more trials and his results were as follows: Outcome Yellow Red Blue Number of times obtained 5 7 8 1. (a) How many trials did Thomas perform in total? (b) What fraction of the trials produced yellow as an outcome? (c) What fraction of the trials produced red as an outcome? (d) What fraction of the trials produced blue as an outcome? The fraction of the trials in an experiment that produce a specific outcome is called the relative frequency of that outcome. Relative frequency of an outcome = number of times the outcome occurred total number of trials A relative frequency can be expressed as a common fraction, as a decimal or as a percentage. The relative frequencies in the results of the experiment Thomas did (question 1) were one quarter for yellow, seven twentieths for red and two fifths for blue. Expressed as percentages, the relative frequencies were 25%, 35% and 40%. The range of Thomas’s relative frequencies, expressed as percentages, is 15% (40% − 25%). 2. (a) Use your calculator to calculate the relative frequencies that you obtained for the three different outcomes in the experiment you did in question 3 on page 294. Express them both as fractions and percentages. (b) Calculate the range of the relative frequencies of the three outcomes for the results of the experiment you did in question 3. (c) You will soon repeat the experiment with three possible outcomes and 12 trials that you did. Do you think the results will be the same as the first time you did the experiment? CHAPTER 26: PROBABILITY 295 3. (a) Join with three or four classmates to work as a team, and discuss question 2(c). (b) Assign the “names” A, B, C, D and E (if there are five of you) to the team members and copy and complete the table below for the experiment you did in question 3 on page 294. Give the relative frequencies as percentages. Note that to calculate the relative frequencies for the totals as percentages, you have to use your calculators. Actual frequencies Relative frequencies% Range Yellow Red Blue Yellow Red Blue Experiment 1 by A Experiment 1 by B Experiment 1 by C Experiment 1 by D Experiment 1 by E Totals for experiment 1 (c) Which of the ranges is the smallest? 26.3 More trials and relative frequencies what happens when you conduct many trials? 1. Join up with your teammates of the previous activity. Each of you will soon repeat the experiment you did previously. You will put a yellow object, a red object and a blue object in a bag, draw one object and note the colour. You will do this 12 times. This will be experiment 2. (a) Do you expect that the results will, in some ways, be the same as for experiment 1 in the previous section? Do not talk to your teammates yet. Form your own opinion, and also consider why you think the results will be different or the same. (b) Share your ideas with your teammates. You will soon repeat the experiment and write the results in the rows for “experiment 2” on the table on the next page. You will repeat it once more and write the results in the rows for “experiment 3”. If you have time left, you may repeat it once more as “experiment 4”. 2. (a) Look at the table on the next page. Certain rows are for the outcomes that you and your teammates obtain. The shaded rows are for adding different sets of outcomes together. Think about what may happen and predict in what rows the ranges will be smaller than in other rows, and in what row the range will be the smallest of all. Copy the table. 296 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 7: TERM 4 (b) Share your ideas with your teammates. 3. (a) Copy the totals for “experiment 1” into the first row of the table. Do the experiment described in question 1 and enter the results in the rows for “experiment 2”. Calculate the relative frequencies and the range. (b) Add in the results of your teammates, add up the totals and calculate the relative frequencies and the range of thetotals. 4. Repeat question 3, and enter the results in the rows for “experiment 3”. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 CHAPTER 26: PROBABILITY 297 Actual frequencies Relative frequencies% Range Yellow Red Blue Yellow Red Blue Totals for experiment 1 Experiment 2 by A Experiment 2 by B Experiment 2 by C Experiment 2 by D Experiment 2 by E Totals for experiment 2 Totals for experiments 1 and 2 combined Experiment 3 by A Experiment 3 by B Experiment 3 by C Experiment 3 by D Experiment 3 by E Totals for experiment 3 Totals for experiments 1, 2 and 3 combined Experiment 4 by A Experiment 4 by B Experiment 4 by C Experiment 4 by D Experiment 4 by E Totals for experiment 4 Totals for experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4 combined",

Which of the following calculations would you choose to calculate the number of yellow beads in this pattern? Do not do any calculations now, just make a choice. (a) 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 (b) 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 (c) 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 (d) 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 (e) 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 (f) 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 2. (a) How many red beads are there in the pattern? How many yellow beads are there? (b) How many beads are there in the pattern in total? 3. (a) Which expression describes what you did to calculate the total number of beads: 70 + 50 or 50 + 70? (b) Does it make a difference? (c) Which expression describes what you did to calculate the number of red beads: 7 × 10 or 10 × 7? (d) Does it make a difference? We say: addition and multiplication are commutative. The numbers can be swopped around as their order does not change the answer. This does not work for subtraction and division, however. 4. Calculate each of the following: (a) 5 × 8 (b) 10× 8 (c) 12× 8 (d) 8 × 12 (e) 6 × 8 (f) 3 × 7 (g) 6 × 7 (h) 7 × 6 1 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS the associative property of addition and multiplication Lebogang and Nathi both have to calculate 25 × 24. Lebogang calculates 25 × 4 and then multiplies by 6. Nathi calculates 25 × 6 and then multiplies by 4. 1. Will they get the same answer or not? If three or more numbers have to be multiplied, it does not matter which two of the numbers are multiplied first. This is called the associative property of multiplication. We also say multiplication is associative. 2. Do the following calculations. Do not use a calculator now. (a) 4 + 7 + 5+ 6 (b) 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 (c) 6 + 5 + 7 + 4 (d) 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 3. (a) Is additionassociative? (b) Illustrate your answer with an example. 4. Find the value of each expression by working in the easiest possible way: (a) 2 × 17× 5 (b) 4 × 7 × 5 (c) 75 + 37 + 25 (d) 60 + 87 + 40 + 13 5. What must you add to each of the following numbers to get 100? 82 44 56 78 24 89 77 6. What must you multiply each of these numbers by to get 1 000? 250 125 25 500 200 50 7. Calculate each of the following. Note that you can make the work very easy by deciding how to group the operations. (a) 82 + 54 + 18 + 46 + 237 (b) 24 + 89 + 44 + 76 + 56 + 11 (c) 25 × (86 × 4) (d) 32 × 125 more conventions and the distributive property The distributive property is a useful property because it allows us to do this: 3 × (2 + 4) 3 × 2 + 3 × 4 Both answers are 18. We used brackets in the first example to show that the addition operation must be done first. Otherwise, we would have done the multiplication first. For example, the expression 3 × 2 + 4 means “multiply 3 by 2; then add 4”. It does not mean “add 2 and 4; then multiply by 3”. MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 2 The expression 4 + 3 × 2 also means “multiply 3 by 2; then add 4”. If you wish to specify that addition or subtraction should be done first, that part of the expression should be enclosed in brackets. The distributive property can be used to break up a difficult multiplication into smaller parts. For example, it can be used to make it easier to calculate 6 × 204: 6 × 204 can be rewritten as 6 × (200 + 4) (Remember the brackets!) = 6 × 200 + 6 × 4 = 1 200 + 24 = 1 224 Multiplication can also be distributed over subtraction, for example to calculate 7 × 96: 7 × 96 = 7 × (100 − 4) = 7 × 100 − 7 × 4 = 700 − 28 = 672 1. Here are some calculations with answers. Rewrite them with brackets to make all the answers correct. (a) 8 + 6 × 5= 70 (b) 8 + 6 × 5 = 38 (c) 5 + 8 × 6 − 2 = 52 (d) 5 + 8 × 6 − 2 = 76 (e) 5 + 8 × 6 − 2 = 51 (f) 5 + 8 × 6 − 2 = 37 2. Calculate the following: (a) 100 × (10 + 7) (b) 100 × 10 + 100 × 7 (c) 100 × (10 − 7) (d) 100 × 10 − 100 × 7 3. Copy and complete the table: × 8 5 4 9 7 3 6 2 10 11 12 7 3 27 6 9 5 8 6 4 28 2 10 80 110 12 11 3 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS 4. Use the various mathematical conventions for numerical expressions to make the following calculations easier. Show how you work them out. (a) 18 × 50 (b) 125× 28 (c) 39 × 220 (d) 443 + 2 100 + 557 (e) 318 + 650 + 322 (f) 522 + 3 003 + 78 Two more properties of numbers are: • The additive property of 0: when we add zero to any number, the answer is that number. • The multiplicative property of 1: when we multiplyanynumberby1,theansweristhatnumber. 1.2 Calculations with whole numbers estimating, approximating and rounding 1. Copy and complete the following statements by giving answers to these questions, without doing any calculations with the given numbers. (a) Is 8 × 117 more than 2 000 or less than 2 000? than 2 000 (b) Is 27 × 88 more than 3 000 or less than 3 000? than 3 000 (c) Is 18 × 117 more than 3 000 or less than 3 000? than 3 000 (d) Is 47 × 79 more than 3 000 or less than 3 000? than 3 000 What you have done when you tried to give answers to questions 1(a) to (d), is called estimation. To estimate is to try to get close to an answer without actually doing the calculations with the given numbers. 2. Look at question 1 again. (a) The numbers 1 000, 2 000, 3 000, 4 000, 5 000, 6 000, 7 000, 8 000, 9 000 and 10 000 are all multiples of a thousand. In each case, write down the multiple of 1 000 that you think is closest to the answer. The numbers you write down are called estimates. (b) In some cases you may achieve a better estimate by adding 500 to your estimate, or subtracting 500 from it. If so, you may add or subtract 500. (c) If you wish, you may write what you believe is an even better estimate by adding or subtracting some hundreds. 3. (a) Use a calculator to find the exact answers for the calculations in question 1. Calculate the error in your last approximation of each of the answers in question 1. (b) What was your smallest error? MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 4 The difference between an estimate and the actual answer is called the error. An estimate may also be called an approximation. 4. Think again about what you did in question 2. In 2(a) you tried to approximate the answers to the nearest 1 000. In 2(c) you tried to approximate the answers to the nearest 100. Describe what you tried to achieve in question 2(b). 5. Estimate the answers for each of the following products and sums. Try to approximate the answers for the products to the nearest thousand, and for the sums to the nearest hundred. (a) 84 × 178 (b) 677 + 638 (c) 124 × 93 (d) 885 + 473 (e) 79 × 84 (f) 921 + 367 (g) 56 × 348 (h) 764 + 829 6. Use a calculator to find the exact answers for the calculations in question 5. Calculate the error in each of your approximations. Use the second line in each question to do this. Calculating with “easy” numbers that are close to given numbers is a good way to obtain approximate answers, for example: • Toapproximate 764 + 829, you may calculate 800 + 800 to get the approximate answer 1 600; with an error of7. • Toapproximate 84 × 178,you may calculate 80 × 200 to get the approximate answer 16 000; with an error of 1 048. 7. Calculate with “easy” numbers close to the given numbers to produce approximate answers for each product below. Do not use a calculator. When you have made your approximations, use a calculator to work out the precise answers. (a) 78× 46 (b) 67 × 88 (c) 34 × 276 (d) 78 × 178 rounding off and compensating 1. (a) Approximate the answer for 386 + 3 435, by rounding both numbers off to the nearest hundred, and then adding the rounded numbers. (b) Because you rounded 386 up to 400, you introduced an error of 14in your approximate answer. What error did you introduce by rounding 3 435 down to 3 400? (c) What combined (total) error did you introduce by rounding both numbers off before calculating? (d) Use your knowledge of the total error to correct your approximate answer, so that you have the correct answer for 386 + 3 435. 5 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS The word compensate means to do things that will remove damage. In question 1, you used rounding off and compensating to find the correct answer for 386 + 3 435. By rounding the numbers off you introduced errors. You then compensated for the errors by making adjustments to your answer. 2. Round off and compensate to calculate each of the following accurately: (a) 473 + 638 (b) 677 + 921 Subtraction can also be done in this way. For example, to work out R5 362 − R2 687,you may round R2 687 up to R3 000. You may do this in the following ways: • Rounding R2 687 up to R3 000 can be done in two steps: 2 687 + 13 = 2 700, and 2 700 + 300 = 3 000. In total, 313 is added. • You can now add 313 to 5 362 too: R5 362 + 313 = 5 675. • Instead of calculating R5 362 − R2 687,which is a bit difficult, you may calculate R5 675 − R3 000. This is easy: R5 675 − R3 000 = R2 675. This means that R5 362 − R2 687 = R2 675, because R5 362 − R2 687 = (R5 362 + R313) − (R2 687 + R313). adding numbers in parts written in columns Numbers can be added by thinking of their parts as we say the numbers. For example, we say 4 994 as four thousand nine hundred and ninety-four. This can be written in expanded notation as 4 000 + 900 + 90 + 4. Similarly, we can think of 31 837 as 30 000 + 1 000 + 800 + 30 + 7. 31837 + 4 994 can be calculated by working with the various kinds of parts separately. To make this easy, you can write the numbers below each other so that the units are below the units, the tens below the tens and so on, as shown on the right. We write only this: In your mind you can seethis: 31 837 30 000 1 000 800 30 7 4 994 4 000 900 90 4 The numbers in each column can be added to get a new set of numbers. 31 837 4 994 30 000 1 000 4 000 800 900 30 90 7 4 11 30 000 5 000 1 700 120 11 120 1 700 5 000 30 000 36 831 It is easy to add the new set of numbers to get the answer. MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 6 31 837 4 994 The work may start with the 10 000s or any other parts. Starting with the units, as shown on page 6, makes it possible to do more of the work mentally, and write less, as shown below. 31 837 To achieve this, only the units digit 1 of the 11 is written in 4 994 the first step. The 10 of the 11 is remembered and added to 36 831 the 30 and 90 of the tens column, to get 130. We say the 10 is carried from the units column to the tens column. The same is done when the tens parts are added to get 130: only the digit “3” is written (in the tens column, so it means 30), and the 100 is carried to the next step. 1. Calculate each of the following without using a calculator: (a) 4 638 + 2 667 (b) 748 + 7246 2. Impilo Enterprises plans a new computerised training facility in their existing building. The training manager has to keep the total expenditure budget under R1 million. This is what she has written so far: Architects and builders Painting and carpeting Security doors and blinds Data projector 25 new secretary chairs 24 desks for workstations 1 desk for presenter 25 new computers 12 colour laser printers R 102 700 R 42 600 R 52 000 R 4 800 R 50 400 R123 000 R 28 000 R300 000 R 38 980 Work out the total cost of all the items for which the training manager has budgeted. 3. Calculate each of the following, without using a calculator: (a) 7 828 + 6 284 (b) 7 826 + 888 + 367 (c) 657 + 32 890 + 6 542 (d) 6 666 + 3 333 + 1 methods of subtraction There are many ways to find the difference between two numbers. For example, to find the difference between 267 and 859, you may think of the numbers as they would appear on a number line, for example: 267 859 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 7 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS We may think of the distance between 267 and 859 as three steps: from 267 to 300, from 300 to 800, and from 800 to 859. How big are each of these three steps? 267 859 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 267 + 33  300 + 500  800 + 59 = 859 This number line shows that 859 − 267 is 33 + 500 + 59. 1. Calculate 33 + 500 + 59 to find the answer for 859 − 267. 2. Calculate each of the following. You may think of working out the distance between the two numbers as shown above, or use any other method you prefer. Do not use a calculator now. (a) 823 − 456 (b) 1 714−829 (c) 3 045 − 2 572 (d) 5 131−367 Like addition, subtraction can also be done by working with the different parts in which we say numbers. For example, 8 764 − 2 352 can be calculated as follows: 8 thousand − 2 thousand = 6 thousand 7 hundred − 3 hundred = 4 hundred 6 tens − 5 tens = 1 ten 4 units − 2 units = 2 units So, 8 764 − 2 352 = 6 412 Subtraction by parts is more difficult in some cases, for example 6 213 − 2 758: 6 000 − 2 000 = 4 000. This step is easy, but the following steps cause problems: 200 − 700 =? 10 − 50 =? 3 − 8 =? Fortunately, the parts and sequence of work may be rearranged to overcome these problems, as shown below: Instead of we may do 3 − 8 = ? 13 − 8 = 5 “borrow” 10 from below 10 − 50 = ? 100 − 50 = 50 “borrow” 100 from below 200 − 700 = ? 1 100 − 700 = 400 “borrow” 1 000 from below 6 000 − 2 000 = ? 5 000 − 2 000 = 3 000 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 8 One way to overcome these problems is to work with negative numbers: 200 − 700 = (−500) 10 − 50 = (−40) 3 − 8 = (−5) 4 000 − 500 → 3 500 − 45 = This reasoning can also be set out in columns: Instead of we may do but write only this 6 000 200 10 3 5 000 1 100 100 13 6 2 1 3 2 000 700 50 8 2 000 700 50 8 2 7 5 8 3 000 400 50 5 3 4 5 5 3. (a) Complete the above calculations and find the answer for 6 213 − 2 758. (b) Use the borrowing technique to calculate 823 − 376 and 6 431 − 4 968. 4. Check your answers in question 3(b) by doing addition. With some practice, you can learn to subtract using borrowing without writing all the steps. When calculating 6 213 − 2 758, use the column method, as shown on the right.

The municipal head gardener wants to buy young trees to plant along the main street of the town. The young trees cost R27 each, and an amount of R9 400 has been budgeted for trees.

(c) How much money will be left if 20 more trees are bought? The municipal gardener wants to work out exactly how many trees, at R27 each, he can buy with the budgeted amount of R9 400. His thinking and writing are described below. Step 1: What he writes: What he thinks: 27 Step 2: I want to find out how many chunks of 27 there are in 9 400.

A number that cannot be expressed as a product of two whole numbers, except as the product 1 × the number itself, is called a prime number. 3. Which of the numbers in question 1 are prime numbers?

Because 2 and 3 are used twice, they are called repeated factors of 36. 5. We can find out if a given number is prime by systematically checking whether the primes 2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; ... are factors of the given number or not. To find possible factors of 131, we need to consider only the primes 2; 3; 5; 7 and 11. Why not 13; 17; 19; ...? 6. Determine whether the following numbers are prime or composite. If the number is composite, write down at least two factors of the number (besides 1 and the number itself). (a) 221 (b) 713 prime factorisation To find all the factors of a number you can write the number as the product of prime factors; first by writing it as the product of two convenient (composite) factors and then by splitting these factors into smaller factors until all factors are prime. Then you take all the possible combinations of the products of the prime factors. Example: Find the factors of 84. Write 84 as the product of prime factors by starting with different known factors: 84 = 4 × 21 or 84 = 7 × 12 or 84 = 2 × 42 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 7 × 3 × 4 = 2 × 6 × 7 = 7 × 3 × 2 × 2 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 A more systematic way of finding the prime factors of a number would be to start with the prime numbers and try the consecutive prime numbers 2; 3; 5; 7; ... as possible factors. The work may be set out as shown below. 2 1 430 3 5 715 3 11 143 3 13 13 7 1 13 1 430 = 2 × 5 × 11× 13 2 457 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 13 We can use exponents to write the products of prime factors more compactly as products of powers of prime factors. 2 457 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 7× 13 = 3 3 × 7 × 13 72 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3× 3 = 2 3 × 3 2 1 500 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 2 2 × 3 × 5 3 13 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS Every composite number can be expressed as the product of prime factors and this can happen in only one way. 2 457 819 273 91 13 1 1. Express the following numbers as the product of powers of primes: (a) 792 (b) 444 2. Find the prime factors of the following numbers: 28 32 124 36 42 345 182 common multiples and factors 1. Is 4 × 5 a multiple of 4? Is 4 × 5 a multiple of 5? 2. Comment on the following statement: The product of numbers is a multiple of each of the numbers in the product. We use common multiples when fractions with different denominators are added. To add 2 + 3 , the common denominator is 3 × 4, so the sum becomes 8 + 9 . 3 4 12 12 In the same way, we could use 6 × 8 = 48 as a common denominator to add 1 + 3 , but 6 8 24 is the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8. Prime factorisation makes it easy to find the LCM or highest common factor. When we simplify a fraction, we divide the same number into the numerator and the denominator. For the simplest fraction, use the highest common factor (HCF) to divide into both the numerator and denominator. So 36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 1 144 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 4 Use prime factorisation to determine the LCM and HCF of 32, 48 and 84 in a systematic way: 32 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2 5 48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 2 4 × 3 84 = 2 × 2 × 3× 7 = 2 2 × 3 × 7 The LCM is a multiple and therefore, all of the factors of all the numbers must divide into it. All of the factors that are present in the three numbers must also be factors of the LCM, even if it is a factor of only one of the numbers. But because it has to be the lowest common multiple, there are no unnecessary factors in the LCM. 14 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 The HCF is divided into the numerator and the denominator to write the fraction in its simplest form. The highest power of each factor is in the LCM, because all of the other factors can divide into it. In 32, 48 and 84, the highest power of 2 is 2 5 , the highest power of 3 is 3 and the highest power of 7 is 7. LCM = 2 5 × 3 × 7 = 672 The HCF is a common factor. Therefore, for a factor to be in the HCF, it must be a factor of all of the numbers. The only number that appears as a factor of all three numbers is 2. The lowest power of 2 is 2 2 ; therefore, the HCF is 2 2 . 3. Determine the LCM and the HCF of the numbers in each case: (a) 24; 28; 42 (b) 17; 21;35 (c) 75; 120; 200 (d) 18; 30; 45 investigate prime numbers 1.4 Solving problems rate and ratio You may use a calculator for the work in this section. 1. Tree plantations in the Western Cape are to be cut down in favour of natural vegetation. There are roughly 3 000 000 trees on plantations in the area and it is possible to cut them down at a rate of 15 000 trees per day with the labour available. How many working days will it take before all the trees will be cut down? Instead of saying “... per day”, people often say “at a rate of ... per day”. Speed is a way in which to describe the rate of movement. 2. A car travels a distance of 180 km in two hours on a straight road. How many kilometres can it travel in three hours at the same speed? 3.

Copy and complete the following table to show how many screws are produced by two machines in different periods oftime: Number of hours 1 2 3 5 8 Number of screws at machine A 1 800 Number of screws at machine B 2 700 (a) How much faster is machine B than machine A? (b) How many screws will machine B produce in the same time that it takes machine A to make 100 screws? The patterns in question 4 can be described like this: In pattern A, the ratio of yellow beads to red beads is 4 to 5. This is written as 4 : 5. In pattern B, the ratio between yellow beads and red beads is 3: 6. In pattern C the ratio is 2 : 7. In question 5, machine A produces two screws for every three screws that machine B produces. This can be described by saying that the ratio between the production speeds of machines A and B is 2 : 3. 6. Nathi, Paul and Tim worked in Mr Setati’s garden. Nathi worked for five hours, Paul for four hours and Tim for three hours. Mr Setati gave the boys R600 for their work. How should they divide the R600 among the three of them? A ratio is a comparison of two (or more) quantities. The number of hours that Nathi, Paul and Tim worked are in the ratio 5: 4 : 3. To be fair, the money should also be shared in that ratio. Therefore, Nathi should receive five parts, Paul four parts and Tim three parts of the money. There were 12 parts, which means Nathi should receive 5 of the total amount, Paul should get 4 and Tim should get 3 . 12 12 12 7. Ntabi uses three packets of jelly to make a pudding for eight people.

Explain. 16 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 We use ratios to show how many times more, or less, one quantity is than another. To increase 40 in the ratio 2 : 3 means that the 40 represents two parts and must be increased so that the new number represents three parts. If 40 represents two parts, 20 represents one part. The increased number will therefore be 20 × 3 = 60. 9. (a) Increase 56 in the ratio 2 : 3. (b) Decrease 72 in the ratio 4 : 3. 10.(a) Divide 840 in the ratio 3 : 4.

(b) How much is one hundredth of R800? (c) How much is seven hundredths of R800? Rashid is a furniture dealer. He buys a couch for R2 420. He displays the couch in his showroom with the price marked as R3 200. Rashid offers a discount of R320 to customers who pay cash. The amount for which a dealer buys an article from a producer or manufacturer is called the cost price. The price marked on the article is called the marked price and the price of the article after discount is the selling price. 2. (a) What is the cost price of the couch in Rashid’s furniture shop? (b) What is the marked price? (c) What is the selling price for a customer who pays cash? (d) How much is ten hundredths ofR3 200? 17 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS Remember that if you multiply by 1, the number does not change. If you multiply by a number greater than 1, the number increases. If you multiply by a number smaller than 1, the number decreases. The discount on an article is always less than the marked price of the article. In fact, it is only a fraction of the marked price. The discount of R320 that Rashid offers on the couch is ten hundredths of the marked price. Another word for hundredths is percentage, and the symbol for percentage is %. We can therefore say that Rashid offers a discount of 10%. A percentage is a number of hundredths. 18% is 18 hundredths and 25% is 25 hundredths. A discount of 6% on an article can be calculated in two steps: Step 1: Calculate one hundredth of the marked price (divide by 100). Step 2: Calculate six hundredths of the marked price (multiply by six). 3. Calculate a discount of 6% on each of the following marked prices of articles: (a) R3 600 (b) R9 360 4. (a) How much is one hundredth of R700? (b) A customer pays cash for a coat marked at R700. He is given a R63 discount. How many hundredths of R700 is this? (c) What is the percentage discount? 5. A client buys a blouse marked at R300 and she is given R36 discount for paying cash. Work as in question 4 to determine what percentage discount she was given. You may use a calculator to do questions 6, 7 and 8. 6. A dealer buys an article for R7 500 and makes the price 30% higher. The article is sold at a 20% discount. (a) What is the selling price of the article? (b) What is the dealer’s percentage profit? When a person borrows money from a bank or some other institution, he or she normally has to pay for the use of the money. This is called interest. 7. Sam borrows R7 000 from a bank at 14% interest for one year. How much does he have to pay back to the bank at the end of the period? 8. Jabu invests R5 600 for one year at 8% interest. (a) What will the value of his investment be at the end of that year? (b) At the end of the year, Jabu does not withdraw the investment or the interest earned; instead, he reinvests it for another year. How much will it be worth at the end of the second year? (c) What will the value of Jabu’s investment be after five years? 18 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 used in the common fraction notation for hundredths. 8 For example: 8% is . 100 that is 100 variation of the % is a symbol for hundredths. 8% means eight hundredths and 15% means 15 hundredths.

He tries to calculate 542 − 253 in a similar way: 500 − 200 = 300 40 − 50 = ? Jimmy clearly has a problem. He reasons as follows: I can subtract 40 from 40; that gives 0. But then there is still 10 that I have to subtract. He decides to deal with the 10 that he still has to subtract later, and continues: 500 − 200 = 300 40 − 50 = 0, but there is still 10 that I have to subtract. 2 − 3 = 0, but there is still 1 that I have to subtract. 1. (a) What must Jimmy still subtract, and what will his final answer be? (b) When Jimmy did another subtraction problem, he ended up with this writing at one stage: 600 and (−)50 and (−)7 What do you think Jimmy’s final answer for this subtraction problem is? About 500 years ago, some mathematicians proposed that a “negative number” may be used to describe the result in a situation, such as in Jimmy’s subtraction problem above, where a number is subtracted from a number smaller than itself. For example, we may say 10 − 20 = (−10). This proposal was soon accepted by other mathematicians, and it is now used all over the world. 19 CHAPTER 2: INTEGERS Mathematicians are people who do mathematics for a living. Mathematics is their profession, like healthcare is the profession of nurses and medical doctors. 500 + 200 = 700 40 + 50 = 90 2 + 3 = 5 700 + 90 + 5 = 795 2. Calculate each of the following: (a) 16− 20 (b) 16 − 30 (c) 16 − 40 (d) 16 −60 (e) 16 − 200 (f) 5 − 1 000 3. Some numbers are shown on the number lines below. Copy the number lines and numbers shown, and fill in the missing numbers. –9 –5 –4 –2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 9 –10 –5 0 5 10 15 The following statement is true if the number is 5: 15 − (a certain number) = 10 A few centuries ago, some mathematicians decided they wanted to have numbers that will also make sentences like the following true: 15 + (a certain number) = 10 But to go from 15 to 10 you have to subtract 5. The number we need to make the sentence 15 + (a certain number) = 10 true must have the following strange property: If you add this number, it should have the same effect as to subtract 5. Now the mathematicians of a few centuries ago really wanted to have numbers for which such strange sentences would be true. So they thought: Let us decide, and agree amongst ourselves, that the number we call negative 5 will have the property that if you add it to another number, the effect will be the same as when you subtract the natural number 5. This means that the mathematicians agreed that 15 + (−5) is equal to 15 − 5. Stated differently, instead of adding negative 5 to a number, you may subtract 5. Adding a negative number has the same effect as subtracting a natural number. For example: 20 + (−15) = 20 − 15 = 5 4. Calculate each of the following: (a) 500 + (−300) (b) 100 + (−20) + (−40) (c) 500 + (−200) + (−100) (d) 100 + (−60) 5. Make a suggestion of what the answer for (−20) + (−40) should be. Give reasons for your suggestion. 20 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 The numbers 1; 2; 3; 4 etc. are called the natural numbers.

The number we need to make the sentence 15 − (a certain number) = 20 true, must have the following property: If you subtract this number, it should have the same effect as to add 5. Let us agree that 15 − (−5) is equal to 15 + 5. Stated differently, instead of subtracting negative 5 from a number, you may add 5. Subtracting a negative number has the same effect as adding a natural number. For example: 20 − (−15) = 20 + 15 = 35 7. Calculate each of the following: (a) 30 − (−10) (b) 30 + 10 (c) 30 + (−10) (d) 30 − 10 (e) 30 − (−30) (f) 30 + 30 (g) 30+ (−30) (h) 30 − 30 You probably agree that: 5 + (−5) = 0 10 + (−10) = 0 and 20 + (−20) = 0 21 CHAPTER 2: INTEGERS We may say that for each “positive” number there is a corresponding or opposite negative number. Two positive and negative numbers that correspond, for example 3 and (−3), are called additive inverses. They wipe each other out when you add them. When you add any number to its additive inverse, the answer is 0 (the additive property of 0). For example, 120 + (−120) = 0. 8. Write the additive inverse of each of the following numbers: (a) 24 (b) −24 (c) −103 (d) 2 348 The idea of additive inverses may be used to explain why 8 + (−5) is equal to 3: 8 + (−5) = 3 + 5 + (−5) = 3 + 0 = 3 9. Use the idea of additive inverses to explain why each of these statements is true: (a) 43 + (−30)= 13 (b) 150 + (−80) = 70 statements that are true for many different numbers 2.2 Adding and subtracting with integers adding can make less and subtraction can make more 1.

The product of a positive number and a negative number is a negative number, for example: 5 × (−6) = −30. The product of a negative number and a positive number is a negative number, for example: (−5) × 6 = −30. 6. (a) Four numerical expressions are given below. Which expressions do you expect to have the same answers?

Consider your answers for question 6. (a) Does multiplication distribute over addition in the case of integers? (b) Illustrate your answer with two examples. 8. Three numerical expressions are given below. Which expressions do you expect to have the same answers? Do not do the calculations. 10 × ((−50) − (−30)) 10 × (−50)− (−30) 10 × (−50) − 10 × (−30) 9. Do the three sets of calculations given in question 8. 26 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 Your work in questions 5, 8 and 9 demonstrates that multiplication with a positive number distributes over addition and subtraction of integers. For example: 10 × (5 + (−3)) = 10 × 2 = 20 and 10 × 5 + 10 × (−3) = 50 + (−30) = 20 10 × (5 − (−3)) = 10 × 8 = 80 and 10 × 5 − 10 × (−3) = 50 − (−30) = 80 10.Calculate: (−10) × (5 + (−3)) Now consider the question of whether or not multiplication with a negative number distributes over addition and subtraction of integers. For example, would (−10) × 5 + (−10) × (−3) also have the answer −20, as does (−10) × (5 + (−3))? 11. What must (−10) × (−3) be equal to, if we want (−10) × 5 + (−10) × (−3) to be equal to −20? In order to ensure that multiplication distributes over addition and subtraction in the system of integers, we have to agree that (a negative number) × (a negative number) is a positive number. For example: (−10) × (−3) = 30. 12. Calculate each of the following: (a) (−10)× (−5) (b) (−10) × 5 (c) 10 × 5 (d) 10 × (−5) (e) (−20) × (−10) + (−20)× (−6) (f) (−20) × ((−10) + (−6)) (g) (−20) × (−10) − (−20)× (−6) (h) (−20) × ((−10) − (−6)) Here is a summary of the properties of integers that make it possible to do calculations with integers: • When a number is added to its additive inverse, the result is 0, for example (+12) + (−12) = 0. • Adding an integer has the same effect as subtracting its additive inverse. For example, 3 + (−10) can be calculated by doing 3 − 10, and the answer is −7. • Subtracting an integer has the same effect as adding its additive inverse. For example, 3 − (−10) can be calculated by doing 3 + 10, and the answer is 13. • The product of a positive and a negative integer is negative, for example (−15) × 6 = −90. • The product of a negative and a negative integer is positive, for example (−15) × (−6) = 90. 27 CHAPTER 2: INTEGERS division with integers 1. (a) Calculate 25 × 8. (b) How much is 200 ÷ 25? (c) How much is 200 ÷ 8? Division is the inverse of multiplication. Therefore, if two numbers and the value of their product are known, the answers to two division problems are also known. 2. Calculate each of the following: (a) 25× (−8) (b) (−125) × 8 3. Use the work you have done for question 2 to write the answers for the following division questions: (a) (−1 000) ÷ (−125) (b) (−1 000) ÷ 8 (c) (−200) ÷ 25 (d) (−200) ÷ 8 4. Can you also work out the answers for the following division questions by using the work you have done for question2? (a) 1 000 ÷ (−125) (b) (−1 000) ÷ (−8) (c) (−100) ÷ (−25) (d) 100 ÷ (−25) When two numbers are multiplied, for example 30 × 4 = 120, the word “product” can be used in various ways to describe the situation: • An expression that specifies multiplication only, such as 30 × 4, is called a product or a product expression. • The answer obtained is also called the product of the two numbers. For example, 120 is called the product of 30 and 4. An expression that specifies division only, such as 30 ÷ 5, is called a quotient or a quotient expression. The answer obtained is also called the quotient of the two numbers. For example, 6 is called the quotient of 30 and 5. 5. In each case, state whether you agree or disagree with the statement, and give an example to illustrate your answer: (a) The quotient of a positive and a negative integer is negative. (b) The quotient of a positive and a positive integer is negative. (c) The quotient of a negative and a negative integer is negative. (d) The quotient of a negative and a negative integer is positive. 6. Do the necessary calculations to enable you to provide the values of the quotients: (a) (−500) ÷ (−20) (b) (−144) ÷ 6 (c) 1 440 ÷ (−60) (d) (−1 440) ÷ (−6) (e) −14 400 ÷ 600 (f) 500 ÷ (−20) 28 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 the associative properties of operations with integers Multiplication of whole numbers is associative. This means that in a product with several factors, the factors can be placed in any sequence, and the calculations can be performed in any sequence. For example, the following sequences of calculations will all produce the same answer: A. 2 × 3, the answer of 2 × 3 multiplied by 5, the new answer multiplied by 10 B. 2 × 5, the answer of 2 × 5 multiplied by 10, the new answer multiplied by 3 C. 10 × 5, the answer of 10 × 5 multiplied by 3, the new answer multiplied by 2 D. 3 × 5, the answer of 3 × 5 multiplied by 2, the new answer multiplied by 10 1. Do the four sets of calculations given in A to D to check whether or not they really produce the same answers. 2. (a) If the numbers 3 and 10 in the calculation sequences A, B, C and D are replaced with −3 and −10, do you think the four answers will still be the same? (b) Investigate to check your expectation. Multiplication with integers is associative. The calculation sequence A can be represented in symbols in only two ways: • 2 × 3 × 5 × 10: The convention to work from left to right unless otherwise indicated with brackets, ensures that this representation corresponds to A. • 5 × (2 × 3) × 10, where brackets are used to indicate that 2 × 3 should be calculated first. When brackets are used, there are different possibilities to describe the same sequence. 3. Express the calculation sequences B, C and D given above symbolically, without using brackets. 4. Investigate, in the same way that you did for multiplication in question 2, whether or not addition with integers is associative. Use sequences of four integers. 5.

Which sequences above are of the same kind as sequence A? Explain your answer. Amanda explains how she figured out how to continue sequence A: I looked at the first two numbers in the sequence and saw that I needed 3 to go from 2 to 5. I looked further and saw that I also needed 3 to go from 5 to 8. I tested that and it worked for all the next numbers. This gave me a rule I could use to extend the sequence: add 3 to each number to find the next number in the pattern. CHAPTER 4: NUMERIC ANd GEOMETRIC PATTERNS 49 A list of numbers which form a pattern is called a sequence. Each number in a sequence is called a term of the sequence. The first number is the first term of the sequence. Tamara says you can also find the pattern by working backwards and subtracting 3 each time: 14 − 3 = 11; 11 − 3 = 8; 8 − 3 = 5; 5 − 3 = 2 2.

Piet explains that he figured out how to continue the sequence F: I looked at the first two terms in the sequence and wrote 2 ×? = 6. When I multiplied the first number by 3, I got the second number: 2 × 3 = 6. I then checked to see if I could find the next number if I multiplied 6 by 3: 6 × 3 = 18. I continued checking in this way: 18 × 3 = 54; 54 × 3 = 162 and so on. This gave me a rule I can use to extend the sequence and my rule was: multiply each number by 3 to calculate the next number in the sequence. Zinhle says you can also find the pattern by working backwards and dividing by 3 each time: 54 ÷ 3 = 18; 18 ÷ 3 = 6; 6 ÷ 3 = 2 1.

If the number we multiply with remains the same throughout the sequence, we say it is a constant ratio.

Copy and complete the following table. Show all your work. Picture number 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 15 Number of circles 1 3 6 10 More than 2 500 years ago, Greek mathematicians already knew that the numbers 3, 6, 10, 15 and so on could form a triangular pattern. They represented these numbers with dots which they arranged in such a way that they formed equilateral triangles, hence the name triangular numbers. Algebraically, we think of them as sums of consecutive natural numbers starting with 1. Let us revisit the activity on triangular numbers that we did on the previous page. Picture 1 Picture 2 Picture 3 Picture 4 So far, we have determined the number of circles in the pattern by adding consecutive natural numbers. If we were asked to determine the number of circles in picture 200, for example, it would take us a very long time to do so. We need to find a quicker method of finding any triangular number in the sequence. Consider the arrangement below. Picture 1 Picture 2 Picture 3 Picture 4 We have added the yellow circles to the original blue circles and then rearranged the circles in such a way that they are in a rectangular form. 5. Picture 2 is three circles long and two circles wide. Copy and complete the following sentences: (a) Picture 3 is circles long and circles wide. (b) Picture 1 is circles long and circle wide. (c) Picture 4 is circles long and circles wide. (d) Picture 5 is circles long and circles wide. 55 CHAPTER 4: NUMERIC ANd GEOMETRIC PATTERNS 6. How many circles will there be in a picture that is: (a) ten circles long and nine circles wide? (b) seven circles long and six circles wide? (c) six circles long and five circles wide? (d) 20 circles long and 19 circles wide? Suppose we want to use a quicker method to determine the number of circles in picture 15. We know that picture 15 is 16 circles long and 15 circles wide. This gives a total of 15 × 16 = 240 circles. But we must compensate for the fact that the yellow circles were originally not there by halving the total number of circles. In other words, the original figure has 240 ÷ 2 = 120 circles. 7. Use the above reasoning to calculate the number of circles in: (a) picture 20 (b) picture 35 4.4 Describing patterns in different ways t-shaped numbers The pattern below is made from squares. 1 2 3 4 1.

To get from seven squares to ten squares, you have to add three squares. Continue to add three squares for each pattern until pattern 20. Plan B: Multiply the pattern number by three and subtract two. Pattern 20 will therefore have 20 × 3 − 2 squares. 56 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 × 3 – 2 Plan C: The number of squares in pattern 5 is 13.

The descriptions in (c), (g) and (h) above are called word formulae. translating between different languages of description A relationship between two quantities can be described in different ways, including: • a table of values of the two quantities • a flow diagram • a word formula • a symbol formula (or symbolic formula). 1. The relationship between two quantities is described as follows: The second quantity is always three times the first quantity plus 8. The first quantity varies between 1 and 5, and it is always a whole number. 64 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 1 2 3 × 4 + 2 4 5 1 2 3 × 2 4 + 1 × 2 5 You will learn about symbolic formulae in Section 5.3.

Many years ago, mathematicians adopted the convention of using the letter symbol x as an abbreviation for the “input number”, and the letter symbol y as an abbreviation for the “output number”. The word formula you wrote for question 1(a) can be written more shortly as: y = 10 × x + 15 Mathematicians have also agreed that one may leave the ×-sign (multiplication sign) out when writing symbolic formulae. So, instead of y = 10 × x + 15, we may write y = 10x + 15. 2. Rewrite your word formulae in questions 1(b) and 1(c) as symbolic formulae. 3. Write a word formula for each of the following relationships: (a) y = 7x + 10 (b) y = 7(x + 10) (c) y = 7(2x + 10) writing symbolic formulae Describe each of the following relationships with a symbolic formula: 1. To calculate the output number, the input number is multiplied by 4 and 7 is subtracted from the answer. 2. To calculate the output number, 7 is subtracted from the input number and the answer is multiplied by 5. 3. Tocalculate the output number, 7 is subtracted from the input number, the answer is multiplied by 5 and 3 is added to this answer. 66 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 Note that it is not at all wrong to use the multiplication sign in symbolic formulae. Letter symbols other than x and y are also used to indicate variable quantities. Chapter 6 Algebraic expressions 1 6.1 Algebraic language words, diagrams and symbols 1. Copy and complete the following table: (a) (b) (c) (d) An algebraic expression indicates a sequence of calculations that can also be described in words or by means of a flow diagram. The flow diagram illustrates the order in which the calculations must be done. In algebraic language, the multiplication sign is usually omitted. So, we write 2x instead of 2 × x. We also write x × 2 as 2x. 2. Write the following expressions in “normal” algebraic language: (a) −2 × a + b (b) a2 67 CHAPTER 6: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 1 Words Flow diagram Expression Multiply a number by two and add six to the answer. × 2 + 6 2 × x + 6 Add three to a number and then multiply the answer by two. × 5 – 1 7 + 4 × x 10 − 5 × x looking different but yet the same 1. Copy and complete the table by calculating the numerical values of the expressions for the values of x. Some answers for x = 1 have been done for you as an example. (a) (b) (c) (d) 2. Do the expressions 2x + 3x and 5x in question 1 above, produce different answers or the same answer for: (a) x = 3? (b) x =10? 3. Do the expressions 2x + 3 and 5xproduce different answers or the same answer for: (a) x = 3? (b) x = 10? 4. Although they maylook different,write downall the algebraicexpressions in question1 that have the same numerical value for the same value(s) of x. Justify your answer. One of the things we do in algebra is to evaluate expressions. When we evaluate an expression we choose or are given a value of the variable in the expression. Now that we have an actual value, we can carry out the operations in the expression using this value, as in the examples given in the table. Algebraic expressions that have the same numerical value for the same value of x but look different, are called equivalent expressions. 5. Say whether the following statements are true or false. Explain your answer in each case. (a) The expressions 2x + 3x and 5xare equivalent. (b) The expressions 2x + 3 and 5xare equivalent. 6. Consider the expressions 3x + 2z + y and 6xyz. (a) What is the value of 3x + 2z + y for x = 4, y = 7 and z = 10? (b) What is the value of 6xyz for x = 4, y = 7 and z = 10? (c) Are the expressions 3x + 2z + y and 6xyz equivalent? Explain. 68 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 Remember that 6xyz is the same as 6 × x × y × z. x 1 3 7 10 2x + 3x 2 × 1 + 3 × 1 2 + 3 = 5 5x 2x + 3 5x 2 5 × (1) 2 5 × 1 = 5 To show that the two expressions in question 5(a) are equivalent, we write 2x + 3x = 5x. We can explain this as: 2x + 3x = (x + x) + (x + x + x) = 5x We say the expression 2x + 3x simplifies to 5x. 7. In each case below, write down an expression equivalent to the one given: (a) 3x + 3x (b) 3x + 8x +2x (c) 8b + 2b + 2b (d) 7m + 2m + 10m (e) 3x 2 + 3x 2 (f) 3x 2 + 8x 2 + 2x 2 8. What is the coefficient of x 2 for the expression equivalent to 3x 2 + 8x 2 + 2x 2 ? In an expression that can be written as a sum, the different parts of the expression are called the terms of the expression. For example, 3x, 2z and y are the terms of the expression 3x + 2z + y. An expression can have like terms or unlike terms, or both. Like terms are terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same power. The terms 2x and 3x are examples of like terms. 9. (a) Copy the diagram. Calculate the numerical value of 10x + 2y for x = 3 and y = 2 by completing the empty spaces in the diagram. Input value: 3 + = (Output value) Input value: 2 (b) What is the output value for the expression 12xy for x = 3 and y= 2? (c) Are the expressions 10x + 2y and 12xy equivalent? Explain. (d) Are the terms 10x and 2y like or unlike terms? Explain. 10.(a) Which of the following algebraic expressions do you think will give the same results? A. 6x + 4x B. 10x C. 10x 2 D. 9x + x (b) Test the algebraic expressions you have identified for the following values of x: x = 10 x = 17 x = 54 (c) Are the terms 6x and 4x like or unlike terms? Explain. (d) Are the terms 10x and 10x 2 like or unlike terms? Explain. 69 CHAPTER 6: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 1 × 10 × 2 The term 3x is a product. The number 3 is called the coefficient of x. 11. Ashraf and Hendrik have a disagreement about whether the terms 7x 2 y 3 and 301y 3 x 2 are like terms or not. Hendrik thinks they are not, because in the first term the x 2 comes before the y 3 , whereas in the second term the y 3 comes before the x 2 . Explain to Hendrik why his argument is not correct. 12. Explain why the terms 5abc, 10acb and 15cba are like terms. 6.2 Add and subtract like terms rearrange terms and then combine like terms 1. Copy and complete the table by evaluating the expressions for the given values of x: x 1 2 10 30x + 80 30 × 1 + 80 = 30 + 80 = 110 5x + 20 30x + 80 + 5x + 20 35x + 100 135x 2. Write down all the expressions in the table that are equivalent. 3. Tim thinks that the expressions 135x and 35x + 100 are equivalent because for x = 1, they both have the same numerical value 135. Explain to Tim why the two expressions are not equivalent. We have already come across the commutative and associative properties of operations. We will now use these properties to help us form equivalent algebraic expressions. Commutative property The order in which we add or multiply numbers does not change the answer: a + b = b + a and ab = ba Associative property The way in which we group three or more numbers when adding or multiplying does not change the answer: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (ab)c = a(bc) 70 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 We can find an equivalent expression by rearranging and combining like terms, as shown below: 30x + 80 + 5x + 20 Hence 30x + (80 + 5x) + 20 Hence 30x + (5x + 80) + 20 = (30x + 5x) + (80 + 20) = 35x + 100 Like terms are combined to form a single term. The terms 30x and 5x are combined to get the new term 35x, and the terms 80 and 20 are combined to form the new term: 100. We say that the expression 30x + 80 + 5x + 20 is simplified to a new expression 35x + 100. 4. Simplify the following expressions: (a) 13x + 7 + 6x− 2 (b) 21x − 8 + 7x + 15 (c) 18c − 12d + 5c − 7c (d) 3abc + 4 + 7abc − 6 (e) 12x 2 + 2x − 2x 2 + 8x (f) 7m 3 + 7m 2 + 9m 3 + 1 When you are not sure about whether or not you correctly simplified an expression, it is always advisable to check your work by evaluating the original expression and the simplified expression for some values. 5. Make a simpler expression that is equivalent to the given expression. Testyour answer for three different values of x, and redo your work until you get it right. (a) Simplify (15x + 7y) + (25x + 3 + 2y) (b) Simplify 12mn + 8mn In questions 6 to 8 below, write down the letter representing the correct answer. Explain why you think your answer is correct. 6. The sum of 5x 2 + x + 7 and x − 9 is: A. x 2 − 2 B. 5x 2 + 2x +16 C. 5x 2 + 16 D. 5x 2 + 2x − 2 7. The sum of 6x 2 − x + 4 and x 2 − 5 is equivalent to: A. 7x 2 − x + 9 B. 7x 2 − x − 1 C. 6x 4 − x − 9 D. 7x 4 − x − 1 8. The sum of 5x 2 + 2x + 4 and 3x 2 − 5x − 1 can be expressed as: A. 8x 2 + 3x + 3 B. 8x 2 + 3x − 3 C. 8x 2 − 3x + 3 D. 8x 2 − 3x − 3 Combining like terms is a useful algebraic habit. It allows us to replace an expression with another expression that may be convenient to work with. Do the questions on page 72 to get a sense of what we are talking about. 71 CHAPTER 6: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 1 When we use a value of the variable in the expression, we call it a substitution. Brackets are used in the expression on the left to show how the like terms have been rearranged. The terms 80 and 20 are called constants. The numbers 30 and 5 are called coefficients. convenient replacements 1. Consider the expression x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x. What is the value of the expression in each of the following cases? (a) x = 2 (b) x = 50 2. Consider the expression x + x + x + z + z + y. What is the value of the expression in each of the following cases? (a) x = 4, y = 7, z = 10 (b) x = 0, y = 8, z = 22 3. Suppose you have to evaluate 3x + 7x for x = 20. Will calculating 10 × 20 give the correct answer? Explain. Suppose we evaluate the expression 3x + 7x for x = 20 without first combining the like terms. We will have to do three calculations, namely 3 × 20, then 7 × 20 and then find the sum of the two: 3 × 20 + 7 × 20 = 60 + 140 = 200. But if we first combine the like terms 3x and 7x into one term 10x, we only have to do one calculation: 10 × 20 = 200. This is one way of thinking about the convenience or usefulness of simplifying an algebraic expression. 4. The expression 5x + 3x is given and you are required to evaluate it for x =8. Will calculating 8 × 8 give the correct answer? Explain. 5. Suppose you have to evaluate 7x + 5 for x = 10. Will calculating 12 × 10 give the correct answer? Explain. 6. The expression 5x + 3 is given and you have to evaluate it for x = 8. Will calculating 8 × 8 give the correct answer? Explain. Samantha was asked to evaluate the expression 12x 2 + 2x − 2x 2 + 8x for x = 12. She thought to herself that just substituting the value of x directly into the terms would require a lot of work. She first combined the like terms as shown below: 12x 2 − 2 2 + 2 + 8x = 10x 2 + 10x Then for x = 10, Samantha found the value of 10x 2 + 10x by calculating: 10 × 10 2 + 10 × 10 = 1 000 + 100 = 1 100 Use Samatha’s way of thinking for questions 7 to 9. 7. What is the value of 12x + 25x + 75x + 8x when x = 6? 8. Evaluate 3x 2 + 7 + 2x 2 + 3 for x = 5. 9. When Zama was asked to evaluate the expression 2n − 1 + 6n for n = 4, she wrote down the following: 2n − 1 + 6n = n + 6n = 6n 2 Hence for n = 4: 6 × (4) 2 = 6 × 8 = 48. Explain where Zama went wrong and why. 72 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 The terms + 2x and – 2x 2 change positions by the commutative property of operations. Worksheet 1.

The following are examples of equations: x + 3 = 11 and 2x = 8 x + 3 = 11 is true if x = 8, but false if x = 3. When we look for a number or numbers that make an equation true, we say that we are solving the equation. For example, x = 4 is the solution of 2x = 8 because it makes 2x = 8 true. (Check: 2 × 4 = 8) looking for numbers to make statements true 1. Are the following statements true or false? Justify your answer. (a) x − 3 = 0, if x = −3 (b) x 3 = 8, if x = −2 (c) 3x = −6, if x = −3 (d) 3x = 1, if x = 1 (e) 6x + 5 = 47, if x = 7 2. Find the original number. Show your reasoning. (a) A number multiplied by 10 is 80. (b) Add 83 to a number and the answer is 100. (c) Divide a number by 5 and the answer is 4. (d) Multiply a number by 4 and the answer is 20. (e) Twice a number is 100. (f) A number raised to the power 5 is 32. (g) A number raised to the power 4 is −81. (h) Fifteen times a number is 90. (i) 93 added to a number is −3. (j) Half a number is 15. 3. Write the equations below in words using “a number” in place of the letter symbol x. Then write what you think “the number” is in each case. Example: 4 + x = 23. Four plus a number equals twenty-three. The number is 19. (a) 8x = 72 (b) 2x = 2 (c) 2x + 5 = 21 5 (d) 12 + 9x = 30 (e) 30 − 2x = 40 (f) 5x + 4 = 3x + 10 Chapter 7 Algebraic equations 1 74 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 1 7.2 Solving equations by inspection the answer is in plain sight 1. Seven equations are given in the following table. Use the table to find out for which of the given values of x it will be true that the left-hand side of the equation is equal to the right-hand side. x −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 2x + 3 −3 −1 1 3 5 7 9 11 x + 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 − x 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 3x − 2 −11 −8 −5 −2 1 4 7 10 10x − 7 −37 −27 −17 −7 3 13 23 33 5x + 3 −12 −7 −2 3 8 13 18 23 10 − 3x 19 16 13 10 7 4 1 −2 (a) 2x + 3 = 5x + 3 (b) 5x + 3 = 9 − x (c) 2x + 3 = x + 4 (d) 10x − 7 = 5x + 3 (e) 3x − 2 = x + 4 (f) 9 − x = 2x + 3 (g) 10 − 3x = 3x − 2 Two or more equations can have the same solution. For example, 5x = 10 and x + 2 = 4 have the same solution; x = 2 is the solution for both equations. 2. Which of the equations in question 1 have the same solutions? Explain. 3. Copy and complete the following table. Then answer the questions that follow. x 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 2x + 3 3x − 10 (a) Can you find a solution for 2x + 3 = 3x − 10 in the table? (b) What happens to the values of 2x + 3 and 3x − 10 as xincreases? Do they become bigger or smaller? (c) Is there a point where the value of 3x − 10 becomes bigger or smaller than the value of 2x + 3 as the value of x increases? If so, between which x-values does this happen? 75 CHAPTER 7: ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 1 This point where the two expressions are equal is called the break-even point. You can also do a search by narrowing down the possible solution to an equation. Two equations are called equivalent if they have the same solution. You can read the solutions of an equation from a table. (d) Now that you narrowed down where the possible solution can be, try other possible values for x until you find out for what value of x the statement 2x + 3 = 3x − 10 is true. 7.3 More examples looking for and checking solutions 1. What is the solution for the equations shown below? (a) x − 3= 4 (b) x + 2 = 9 (c) 3x = 21 (d) 3x + 1 = 22 When a certain number is the solution of an equation we say that the number satisfies the equation. For example, x = 4 satisfies the equation 3x = 12 because 3 × 4 = 12. 2. Choose the number in brackets that satisfies the equation. Explain your choice. (a) 12x= 84 {5; 7; 10; 12} (b) 84 x = 12 {−7; 0; 7; 10} (c) 48 = 8k + 8 {−5; 0; 5; 10} (d) 19 − 8m = 3 {−2; −1; 0; 1; 2} (e) 20 = 6y − 4 {3; 4; 5; 6} (f) x 3 = −64 {−8; −4; 4; 8} (g) 5 x = 125 {−3; −1; 1; 3} (h) 2 x = 8 {1; 2; 3; 4} (i) x 2 = 9 {1; 2; 3; 4} 3.

Chapter 8 Algebraic expressions 2 8.1 Expanding algebraic expressions multiply often or multiply once: it is your choice 1. (a) Calculate 5 × 13 and 5 × 87 and add the two answers. (b) Add 13 and 87, and then multiply the answer by 5. (c) If you do not get the same answer for questions 1(a) and 1(b), you have made a mistake. Redo your work until you get it right. If you work correctly, you get the same answer for questions 1(a) and 1(b); this is an example of a certain property of addition and multiplication called the distributive property. You use this property each time you multiply a number in parts. For example, you may calculate 3 × 24 by calculating 3 × 20 and 3 × 4, and then add the two answers: 3 × 24 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 4 What you saw in question 1 was that 5 × 100 = 5 × 13 + 5 × 87. This can also be expressed by writing 5(13 + 87). 2. (a) Calculate 10 × 56. (b) Calculate 10 × 16 + 10 × 40. 3. Write down any two numbers smaller than 100. Let us call them x and y.

Correct your work. 4. Copy and complete the followingtable: (a) 77 CHAPTER 8: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 2 The word distribute means “to spread out”.

Correct your work. In algebra we normally write 3(x + 2) instead of 3 × (x + 2). The expression 3 × (x + 2) does not mean that you should first multiply by 3 when you evaluate the expression for a certain value of x. The brackets tell you that the first thing you should do is add the value(s) of x to 2 and then multiply the answer by 3. However, instead of first adding the values within the brackets and then multiplying the answer by 3, we may just do the calculation 3 × x + 3 × 2 = 3x + 6 as shown in the table. (c) Which expressions amongst those given in the table on page 77 are equivalent? Explain. (d) For what value(s) of x is 3(x + 2) = 3x + 2? (e) Try to find a value of x such that 3(x + 2) ≠ 3x + 6. If multiplication is the last step in evaluating an algebraic expression, then the expression is called a product expression or, briefly, a product. The way you evaluated the expression 3(x + 2) in the table is an example of a product expression. 5. (a) Determine the value of 5x + 15 if x = 6. (b) Determine the value of 5(x + 3) if x = 6.

Explain. 5x We have found that quotient expressions, such as 10x  5x 2 5x can sometimes be manipulated to give equivalent expressions, such as 2 − x. The value of this is that these equivalent expressions require fewer calculations. 83 CHAPTER 8: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 2 The expressions 10x  5x 2 5x and 2 − x are not quite equivalent because for x = 0, the value of 2 − x can be calculated, while the first expression has no value. However, we can say that the two expressions are equivalent if they have the same values for all values of x admissible for both expressions. How is it possible that 7x 2  5x x = 7x + 5 and 10x  5x 2 5x = 2 − x for all admissible values of x? We say x = 0 is not an admissible value of x because division by 0 is not allowed. One of the methods for finding equivalent expressions for algebraic fractions is by means of division: 7x 2  5x 1 3 1 = (7x 2 + 5x) [just as x x = 3 × ] 5 5 = ( 1 x = 7x 2 x × 7x 2 ) + ( 1 x + 5x x × 5x) [distributive property] = 7x + 5 [provided x ≠ 0] 4.

Chapter 9 Algebraic equations 2 88 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 2 × 5 x −3 −2 0 5 17 2x + 6 × 5 One of the things we do in algebra is to evaluate expressions. When we evaluate expressions we replace a variable in the expression with an input number to obtain the value of the expression called the output number. We think of this process as a doing process. However, in other cases we may need to undo what was done. When we know what output number was obtained but do not know what input number was used, we have to undo what was done in evaluating the expression. In such a case we say we are solving an equation. 6. Look again at questions 1 to 5. For each question, say whether the question required a doing or an undoing process. Give an explanation for your answer (for example: input to output). 7. (a) Copy and complete the following flowdiagrams: 1 7 (b) What do you observe? 8.

When a certain number is divided by 5 the answer is 1. What is the number? 13.

When a certain number is multiplied by 5 and 2 is subtracted from the answer, the final answer is 13. What is the original number? Moving from the output value to the input value is called solving the equation for the unknown. 9.2 Solving equations using the additive and multiplicative inverses finding the unknown Consider the equation 3x + 2 = 23. We can represent the equation 3x + 2 = 23 in a flow diagram, where x represents an unknown number: x 23 When you reverse the process in the flow diagram, you start with the output number 23, then subtract 2 and then divide the answer by 3: 23 Wecan write all of the above reverse process asfollows: Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x + 2 – 2 = 23 − 2 3x = 21 Divide both sides by 3: 3x = 21 3 3 x = 7 We say x = 7 is the solution of 3x + 2 = 23, because 3 × 7 + 2 = 23. We say that x = 7 makes the equation 3x + 2 = 23 true. The numbers + 2 and − 2 are additive inverses of each other. When we add a number and its additive inverse we always get 0. The numbers 3 and 1 are multiplicative 3 inverses of each other. When we multiply a number and its multiplicative inverse we always get 1,so 3 × 1 =1. 3 90 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 2 – 2 ÷ 3 The additive and multiplicative inverses help us to isolate the unknown value or the input value.

Check your answers. 1. x + 10 = 0 2. 49x + 2 = 100 3. 2x = 1 4. 20 = 11 − 9x In some cases you need to collect like terms before you can solve the equations using additive and multiplicative inverses, as in the example below: Example: Solve for x: 7x + 3x = 10 10x = 10 10x = 10 10 10 x = 1 5. 4x + 6x= 20 6. 5x = 40 +3x 7. 3x + 1 − x = 0 8. x + 20 + 4x = −55 9.3 Solving equations involving powers Solving an exponential equation is the same as asking the question: To what exponent must the base be raised in order to make the equation true? 1.

Read through the following steps: Step 1: Place the compass on one endpoint of the line segment (point A). Draw an arc above and below the line. (Notice that all the points on the arc above and belowthelinearethesame distance frompoint A.) A B Step 2: Without changing the compass width, place the compass on point B. Draw an arc above and below the line so that the arcs A B cross the first two. (The two points where the arcs cross are the same distance away from point A and from point B.) C Step 3: Use a ruler to join the points where the arcs intersect. This line segment (CD) is the bisector of AB. 90° A B D Notice that CD is also perpendicular to AB. Therefore, CD is a perpendicular bisector. 2. Use a compass and a ruler to practise drawing perpendicular bisectors on line segments. 93 CHAPTER 10: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES intersect means to cross or meet. A perpendicular is a line that meets another line at an angle of 90°. try this! Use only a protractor and ruler to draw a perpendicular bisector on a line segment.

Read through the followingsteps: Step 1: Place your compass on the given point (point P). Draw an arc across the line on each side of the given point. Do not adjust the compass width when drawing the second arc. Step 2: From each arc on the line, draw another arc on the opposite side of the line from the given point (P). The two new arcs will intersect. Step 3: Use your ruler to join the given point (P) to the point where the arcs intersect (Q). PQ is perpendicular to AB. We also write it like this: PQ ⊥ AB. 2.

Do not adjust the compass width when drawing the second arc. Step 2: Open your compass so that it is wider than the distance from one of the arcs to point P. Place the compass on each arc and draw an arc above or below the point P. The two new arcs will intersect.

If you know how to construct parallel lines, you should be able to construct any quadrilateral accurately. CHAPTER 10: CONSTRUCTION OF GEOMETRIC FIGURES 105 constructing parallel lines to draw quadrilaterals 1. Read through the following steps: Step 1: From line segment AB, mark a point D. This point D will be on the line that will be parallel to AB. Draw a line from A through D. Step 2: Draw an arc from A that crosses AD and AB. Keep the same compass width and draw an arc from point D as shown. D D A B A B Step 3: Set the compass width to the distance between the two points where the first arc crosses AD and AB. From the point where the second arc crosses AD, draw a third arc to cross the second arc. Step 4: Draw a line from D through the point where the two arcs meet. DC is parallel to AB.

We can classify or name different types of triangles according to the lengths of their sides and according to the sizes of theirangles. naming triangles according to their sides 1. Copy the table and match the name of each type of triangle with its correct description: Name of triangle Description of triangle Isosceles triangle All the sides of a triangle are equal. Scalene triangle None of the sides of a triangle are equal. Equilateral triangle Two sides of a triangle are equal. 2.

Properties of triangles: • The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°. • An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and each interior angle is equal to 60°. • An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. • A scalene triangle has no sides equal. • A right-angled triangle has a right angle (90°). • An obtuse triangle has one obtuse angle (between 90° and 180°). • An acute triangle has three acute angles (< 90°). 11.2 Unknown angles and sides of triangles You can use what you know about triangles to obtain other information. When you work out new information, you must always give reasons for the statements you make. Look at the following examples of working out unknown angles and sides when certain information is given. The reason for each statement is written in square brackets. A J D B L C E F K A  = B  = C  = 60° [Angles in an equilateral ∆ = 60°] DE = DF [Given] E  = F  [Angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles ∆ are equal]  J = 55° [The sum of the interior angles of a ∆ = 180°; so  J = 180° – 40° – 85°] You can shorten the following reasons in the ways shown: • Sum of interior angles (∠s) of a triangle (∆) = 180°: Interior ∠s of ∆ • Isosceles triangle has two sides and two angles equal: Isosceles ∆ • Equilateral triangle has three sides and three angles equal: Equilateral ∆ • Angles forming a straight line = 180°: Straightline 110 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 2 40° 85° interior angles are the angles inside a closed shape; not the angles outside of it. 45° 60° 32° working out unknown angles and sides Find the sizes of unknown angles and sides in the following triangles.

In many quadrilaterals all the sides are of different lengths and all the angles are of different sizes. You have previously worked with these types of quadrilaterals, in which some sides have the same lengths, and some angles may be of the same size: parallelograms rectangles kites rhombuses squares trapeziums the properties of different types of quadrilaterals 1. In each of the following questions, different examples of a certain type of quadrilateral are given. In each case identify which kind of quadrilateral it is. Describe the properties of each type by making statements about the lengths and directions of the sides and the sizes of the angles of each type. You may have to take some measurements to be able to do this. (a) 115 CHAPTER 11: GEOMETRY OF 2d SHAPES (b) (c) (d) (e) 116 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 2 (f) 2. Use your completed lists and the drawings in question 1 to determine if the following statements are true or false: (a) A rectangle is a parallelogram. (b) A square is a parallelogram. (c) A rhombus is a parallelogram. (d) A kite is a parallelogram. (e) A trapezium is a parallelogram. (f) A square is a rhombus. (g) A square is a rectangle. (h) A square is akite. (i) A rhombus is a kite. (j) A rectangle is a rhombus. (k) A rectangle is a square. If a quadrilateral has all the properties of another quadrilateral, you can define it in terms of the other quadrilateral, as you have found above. 3. Here are some conventional definitions of quadrilaterals: • A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two opposite sides parallel. • A rectangle is a parallelogram that has all four angles equal to 90°. • A rhombus is a parallelogram with all four sides equal. • A square is a rectangle with all four sides equal. • A trapezium is a quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel. • A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides equal. 117 CHAPTER 11: GEOMETRY OF 2d SHAPES A convention is something (such as a definition or method) that most people agree on, accept and follow. Write down other definitions that work for the following quadrilaterals: (a) Rectangle (b) Square (c) Rhombus (d) Kite (e) Trapezium 11.4 Unknown angles and sides of quadrilaterals finding unknown angles and sides Find the length of all the unknown sides and angles in the following quadrilaterals.

(3x) cm P S (x) cm R Q 11.5 Congruency what is congruency? 1. ∆ABC is reflected in the vertical line (mirror) to give ∆KLM. Are the sizes and shapes of the two triangles exactly the same? 2. ∆MON is rotated 90° around point F to give you ∆TUE. Are the sizes and shapes of ∆MON and ∆TUE exactly the same? 3. Quadrilateral ABCD is translated six units to the right and one unit down to give quadrilateral XRZY. Are ABCD and XRZY exactly the same? In the previous activity, each of the figures was transformed (reflected, rotated or translated) to produce a second figure. The second figure in each pair has the same angles, side lengths, size and area as the first figure. The second figure is therefore an accurate copy of the first figure. 119 CHAPTER 11: GEOMETRY OF 2d SHAPES A K B C L M Mirror T E M N O F U A six units right D X one unit down Y C B Z R When one figure is an image of another figure, we say that the two figures are congruent. The symbol for congruency is: ≡ Notation of congruent figures When we name shapes that are congruent, we name them so that the matching, or corresponding, angles are in the same order. For example, in ∆ABC and ∆KLM on the previous page: A  is congruent to (matches and is equal to) K  . B  is congruent to M  . C  is congruent to L  . We therefore use this notation: ∆ABC ≡ ∆KML. We cannot assume that, when the angles of polygons are equal, the polygons are congruent. You will learn about the conditions of Similarly, for the other pairs of figures on the previous page: congruence in Grade 9. ∆MON ≡ ∆TUE and ABCD ≡ XRZY. The notation of congruent figures also shows which sides of the two figures correspond and are equal. For example, ∆ABC ≡ ∆KML shows that: AB = KM, BC = ML and AC = KL. The incorrect notation ∆ABC ≡ ∆KLM would show the following incorrect information: B  = L  , C  = M  , AB = KL and AC = KM. identifying congruent angles and sides Copy the following table and write down which angles and sides are equal between each pair of congruent figures: 1. ∆PQR ≡∆UCT 2. ∆KLM ≡ ∆UWC 3. ∆GHI ≡ ∆QRT 4. ∆KJL ≡ ∆POQ 11.6 Similarity In Grade 7, you learnt that two figures are similar when they have the same shape (their angles are equal) but they may be different sizes. The sides of one figure are proportionally longer or shorter than the sides of the other figure; that is, the length of each side is multiplied or divided by the same number. We say that one figure is an enlargement or a reduction of the other figure. 120 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 2 The word congruent comes from the Latinwordcongruere, which means “to agree”. Figures are congruent if they match up perfectly when laid on top of each other. checking for similarity 1. Look at the rectangles below and answer the questions that follow: K M A D J R cta ngl e 2 Re cta ngl 1 F H I L (a) Look at rectangle 1 and ABCD. How many times is FH longer than BC? How many times is GF longer than AB? (b) Look at rectangle 2 and ABCD. How many times is IL longer than BC? How many times is LM longer than CD? (c) Is rectangle 1 or rectangle 2 an enlargement of rectangle ABCD? Explain your answer. 2. Look at the triangles below and answer the questions that follow: J I K (a) How many times is: • FG longer than BC? HF longer than AB? • HG longer than AC? IK shorter than BC? • JI shorter than AB? JK shorter than AC? (b) Is ∆HFG an enlargement of ∆ABC? Explain your answer. (c) Is ∆JIK a reduction of ∆ABC? Explain your answer. In the previous activity, rectangle KILM is an enlargement of rectangle ABCD. Therefore, ABCD is similar to KILM. The symbol for “is similar to” is: /// .Sowe write: ABCD /// KILM. The triangles on the previous page are also similar. ∆HFG is an enlargement of ∆ABC, and ∆JIK is a reduction of ∆ABC. In ∆ABC and ∆HFG, A  = H  , B  = F  and C  = G  . We therefore write it like this: ∆ABC /// ∆HFG. In the same way, ∆ABC /// ∆JIK. 121 CHAPTER 11: GEOMETRY OF 2d SHAPES When you enlarge or reduce a polygon, you need to enlarge or reduce all its sides proportionally, or by the same ratio. This means that you multiply or divide each length by the same number. Similar figures are figures that have the same angles (same shape) but are not necessarily the same size. using properties of similar and congruent figures 1. Are the triangles in each pair similar?

Use a protractor to measure the sizes of all the angles in each figure. Write down your answers. 2. Use your answers to determine the following sums: (a) 1  + 2  (b) 3  + 4  + 5   The sum of angles that are formed on a straight line is equal to 180°. (We can shorten this property as: ∠s on a straight line.) Two angles whose sizes add up to 180° are also called supplementary angles, for example 1  + 2  . Angles that share a vertex and a common side are D common side 1 2 said to be adjacent. So 1  + 2  are therefore also A called supplementary adjacent angles. C B same vertex 124 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 2 Chapter 12 Geometry of straight lines A 1 2 B 3 4 5 When two lines are perpendicular, their adjacent D supplementary angles are each equal to 90°.

When the alternate angles lie outside of the two lines, they are called alternate exterior angles. In the figure, these are alternate exterior angles: • a and g • b and h. 2.

Not coloured in Fraction notation Decimal notation (a) (b) (c) (d) Decimal fractions and common fractions are simply different ways of expressing the same number. We call them different notations. To write a common fraction as a decimal fraction, we must first express the common fraction with a power of ten (10, 100, 1 000, etc.) as the denominator. For example: = × 5 = 45 = 0,45 20 20 5 100 If you have a calculator, you can also divide the numerator by the denominator to get the decimal form of a fraction, for example: 9 20 To write a decimal fraction as a common = 9 ÷ 20 = 0,45. fraction, we must first express it as a common fraction with a power of ten as the denominator and then simplify if necessary.

Fractions with the same denominator are easier to compare. For this and other reasons, fractions are often expressed as hundredths. A fraction expressed as hundredths is called a percentage. Instead of six hundredths we can say 6 per cent, 6 or 0,06. 6 per cent, 6 100 and 0,06 are just three different ways of writing the same number. 100 The symbol % is used for per cent.

We use the word hypotenuse to indicate the side opposite the 90° angle of a right-angled triangle. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle. A triangle with no right angle, therefore, does not have a hypotenuse. investigating the relationship between the lengths of sides 1. Study the figures below.

It can be stated in terms of area as follows: If a triangle has a right angle, then the area of the square with a side on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. The reference to area can be left out. If a triangle is a right-angled triangle, then the square A of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. b We can express the relationship between the lengths of the sides of the triangle by means of the equation c 2 = a 2 + b 2 ; where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides.

You learnt in Sections 15.1 and 15.2 that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. How can we tell whether a triangle is right-angled if we are given the lengths of the sides? One way is to use the “converse” of the Pythagoras theorem. The converse states that if the sum of the squares of the lengths of two sides equals the square of the length of the longest side, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle. We can also state the converse as follows: If a triangle has side lengths a, b and c such that c 2 = a 2 + b 2 , then the triangle is a right-angled triangle. In the questions that follow, you have to determine whether triangles are right-angled or not. Study the following example first: = 81 + 144 = 225 (Longest side length) 2 = Sum of squares of other two sides lengths And this can be written as 15 2 = 9 2 + 12 2 ∴ The triangle is right-angled. 9 Example: Determine whether the triangle is right-angled or not.

If the triangle is obtuse angled, the line showing the height is outside the triangle. For example, in M L ∆JKL, JM is the height with respect to the base KL.

Write down the diameters of circles with the following radii: (a) r = 8 cm (b) r = 1 m (c) r = 4,5 cm (d) r = 6,2 m relationship between a circle’s circumference and diameter If you do not know where the centre of a circle is, you can determine it by measuring the diameter as follows: • Mark a point on the circle from which to measure. • Keeping the ‘0’ of the ruler in place, move the other end of the ruler until you find the longest distance. This is the diameter. You can get a rough measurement of the circumference of a circle as follows: • Use a string and lay it around the edge of the circle as accurately as possible. • Mark the string when you reach the point where you first started measuring. • Straighten the string and measure the length using a ruler. mark here 180 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 Circles of different sizes are given below. The circumferences are shown in the table in question 2, rounded off to two decimal places. Copy the table. 1. Measure the diameter of each circle and write it in the table. A 2.

What do you notice? pi (π) and the formula for the circumference of a circle In the previous activity, you should have found that the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter is always equal to the same number. This number is a constant value and is called pi. Piis a Greek letter and its symbol is π. CHAPTER 16: PERIMETER ANd AREA OF 2d SHAPES 181 B E D C π You also worked with values rounded off to two decimal places (hundredths). However, π is an irrational number. This means that the numbers after the decimal comma go on and on without ending and without repeating. On a calculator, you will find that the value for π is given as 3,141592654 (correct to nine decimal places). When we use π in our calculations, we usually round it off as π ≈ 22 7 or 3,14. In the previous activity, you found that, for any circle, C d = (the circumference divided by its diameter is equal to the constant, π). Therefore, if we multiply the diameter of a circle by π, we should get the circumference of the circle: Circumference of a circle (C) = πd = π(2r) = 2πr using the formula for the circumference of a circle In the following calculations, use π = 3,14and round off your answers to two decimal places where necessary. 1. Calculate the circumference of a circle with: (a) a radius of 2 cm (b) a radius of 10 mm (c) a diameter of 8 cm (d) a diameter of 25 mm (e) a radius of 40 m (f) a diameter of 100 m 2. Calculate the radius and circumference of a circle with a diameter of: (a) 125 mm (b) 70 cm 3. Calculate the radius of a circle with a circumference of: (a) 110 cm (b) 200 m 16.4 Area of circles investigating the formula for the area of a circle 1. Each square in the grid on the following page measures 1 cm by 1 cm (1 cm 2 ). (a) Count the number of squares inside the circle. Estimate what the parts of squares add up to. What is the area inside the circle? (b) What is the radius (r) of the circle? (c) How accurate is the above method for finding the area of a circle? (d) How can we improve on this method of using squares to approximate the area of a circle? 182 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 (e) Suppose instead of using 1 cm by 1 cm squares we use 0,5 cm by 0,5 cm squares to measure the area of the circle above. Which of the two measurements of area will be more accurate? Explain. (f) Now suppose we use squares that are 0,25 cm by 0,25 cm. Which measurement will be the best estimate of the three? Wecan estimate area by placing a square grid over the surface of which we want to estimate. We can then count approximately how many squares are needed tocover the surface wewish to measure. In the case of a curved surface like a circle, the area cannot be accurately determined in this way; it can only be estimated. The accuracy of the estimate depends on the size of the squares used. Consider the circle alongside. It has been divided into 16 identical sectors. We will use a technique that mathematicians sometimes use to transform a shape into one that they know something about in order to solve a problem. 183 CHAPTER 16: PERIMETER ANd AREA OF 2d SHAPES In this activity we are going to develop a formula for calculating the area of a circle. The challenge here is that we want to find a way to calculate the area of a circle. We know how to find the area of a rectangle. Is there a way that we can redraw a circle so that it looks something like a rectangle? One way to go about this is to divide the circle into 16 identical sectors. We then cut the circle into 16 different pieces as shown below: We then re-arrange the sectors like this: height base 2. We have transformed the circle by cutting it into identical sectors and re-arranging them. What does this shape look like? 3. What does the: (a) height of the shape above match in the original circle? (b) base of the shape match in the original circle? 4. Is there a way in which we can make the challenge easier for ourselves? 5. The last sector in the arrangement below is further divided in half. (a) What shapes are formed from dividing the sector? (b) What new shape will be formed by placing each half of the sector on either side of the shape above? 6. To what does the: (a) height of the new shape correspond in the original circle? (b) base of the new shape correspond in the original circle? 184 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 You have probably noticed that when we divide a circle into many sectors and then re-arrange the sectors, they form a rectangular shape. Try to make sense of the argument presented below. 1 length = circumference 2 height = radius C = 2πr Area = l × b Area = 1 2 Area = πr 2 × 2 × π × r × r 7. (a) Use the formula A = πr 2 to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 4 cm. Use π =3,14. (b) How close is this answer to the number of squares you calculated inside the circle in question 1 on page182? From now onwards we will use the formula A = πr 2 to calculate the area of a circle, where r is the length of the radius. You will be given the value of π to use in the calculations. The value of π is usually given correct to two decimal places as 3,14. 8. How can we interpret r 2 in the formula A = πr 2 ? Use the figure on the right to answer the following questions: (a) What is the radius of the circle? (b) The length of the blue square is 1,5 cm. What is its area? (c) What is the value of r 2 ? (d) If r is the radius of a circle, then r 2 is ... 3 cm 3 cm using the formula for the area of a circle In the following calculations, use 3,14as an approximation for π and round your answers off to two decimal places. Use a calculator where necessary. 185 CHAPTER 16: PERIMETER ANd AREA OF 2d SHAPES r = 7 cm r = 12 cm 1. Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of: (a) r = 8 cm (b) r = 4,5 cm 2.

We call the size of this flat surface the area of the shape. A 3D object has more than one surface. For example, a cube has six surfaces, or faces. The sizes of these surfaces on the outside of the 3D object are called its surface area. A 2D shape is flat, so it takes up space in only two directions. But a 3D object has height as well, so it takes up space in a third direction also. The space that a 3D object takes up is called its volume. investigating the surface area and volume of a book Work with a partner. Choose a book each. The books must be different sizes. 1. Run your hand over all the outside surfaces of your book. How many surfaces (or faces) does your book have? 2.

How could you calculate which book really takes up the most space? 17.2 Surface area of 3D objects using nets to explore surface area The surface area of an object is equal to the sum of the areas of all its faces. So we can use the net of an object to investigate its surface area. The following diagrams show 3D objects with their matching nets: 1.

(b) What is the total volume of the 1 mm 3 cubes forming the 1 cm 3 cube? practise converting between units When working with volume, you often have to convert between different cubic units. Here are two examples of how you can work out equivalent units. Converting cm 3 to mm 3 : Converting cm 3 tom 3 : 1 cm 3 = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm 1 cm 3 = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm = 10 mm × 10 mm ×10 mm = 0,01 m × 0,01 m × 0,01m = 1 000 mm 3 = 0,000001 m 3 ∴ multiply by 1 000 ∴ multiply by 0,000001 or divide by 1 000 000 1.

As soon as you place marbles into the water, the level of the water rises. This is not because the amount of water has changed, but rather because the marbles have taken the place of the water and have pushed the water higher up in the vase. If one of the marbles has a volume of 1 cm 3 , it would displace 1 ml of water. ∴ We know that: 1 cm 3 = 1 ml 1 m 3 = 1 kl 1. Calculate the capacities of the following containers.

The term data handling is used to describe certain ways of trying to make sense of large collections of observations (data) about things in the real world. Data can be about many different things, for example people’s opinions on politics or the success rates of treating people with a certain kind of medicine. We use data to help us make decisions and solve problems about the world around us. 18.1 Collecting data To find out more about any situation, we need to start by asking questions and collecting data. When you collect data, you need to consider: • what you want to find out or the questions that you want to answer • where you will find the data to answer the questions (for example, from people such as learners in your school, your family and community; or from published sources such as newspapers, books or magazines) • who you will collect the data from (all of the people or a sample) • how you will collect the data (such as using questionnaires or interviews). sources of data collection In some cases you can use data that has already been collected by another person or organisation. Example 1 Your question is: What is the most common form of transport that learners in South Africa use to travel to school? For this question, you will find that this data already exists in a publication called Census @ School 2009, published by Statistics South Africa. You can then present and interpret the existing data. Example 2 Your question is: What is the most common form of transport that learners at my school use to travel to school? Chapter 18 Collect, organise and summarise data 198 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 Check with the principal whether such data has already been collected by the school. If the data does not exist, or is very old, you need to decide where to get the data from. You could then decide to collect the data yourself from your peers. Copy the following table. For each of the following investigation questions, write down what or who would most likely be an appropriate source of information. Question Appropriate source of data collection 1. What is the favourite type of music amongst teenagers in my community? 2. How much money do workers at Dress Factory earn per week? 3. To what height do baobab trees usually grow? 4. What are the ages of learners in Grades R to 7 in South Africa? 5. How many people in South Africa have access to electricity? 6. How many people in different African countries had malaria during the last five years? 7. Has my school recycled more or fewer glass bottles this year than last year? 8. What kind of household chores do seven- to ten-year-olds in my neighbourhood usually do? 9. How many children in South Africa under the age of ten have been vaccinated to protect them from childhood diseases? populations and samples The whole group of people (or things) that you want to find out about is usually referred to as the population. A population is often quite large. The size of the population depends on what you need to find out. The larger your population, the more difficult it becomes to ask each member of that population the questions you want to ask. CHAPTER 18: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 199 You could choose a smaller group of individuals from the population. Such a group, that is used to represent the whole population, is called a sample. Examples 1. You may want to find out how much time the learners in a school spend on doing homework. If there are many learners in the school, you may be unable to ask them all about it. What you can do in this case is to talk to some learners in each class in the school. You may, for instance, speak to five learners from each class. 2. Health researchers may collect information about children by doing a survey of households selected randomly in each community. random samples A sample has to be chosen carefully to make sure that it represents the population. To understand what this means, think about what happens if you choose some beans from a jar in which the different kinds of beans are in separate layers. If you take a sample of the beans at the top, the sample is not representative. If the beans are all mixed up, then each bean has an equal chance of being chosen. The sample will be representative. Sample Sample Example You could select a random sample of learners from your school in the following two ways: 1. You may write the names of all the learners on separate paper strips. You then put all the strips in a plastic bag, mix them up, and draw 30 strips without looking at the names before you have finished. 2. You could select every fifth name from each of the class lists. Look at the investigation questions. Which of the samples given do you think will reflect the whole population more appropriately? Copy the following table. Tick your choice and give a reason. Sample 1 Sample 2 Reason 1. What is the type of music liked by most teenagers in my community? 50 teenagers at a local school 25 teenagers each from two different local schools 200 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 2. How much money do the 200 workers at Dress Factory earn per week? The workers at every fourth workstation in the factory The 50 workers that gather outside during lunch break 3. To what height do baobab trees usually grow? All baobab trees in a marked-off area Every second baobab tree in a marked-off area 4. What are the ages of learners in Grades R to 7 in South Africa? All the Grade R to 7 learners in my school Ten learners in each grade from Grade R to 7 at three different schools 5. Has my school recycled more or fewer glass bottles this year than last year? All the glass bottles recycled in one month this year and in the same month last year The glass bottles recycled in one month this year and in any other month last year questionnaires We can use different methods to collect data, for example questionnaires, face-to-face interviews or telephonic interviews. In this section, you will work with questionnaire questions that have multiple-choice responses. Here are two questions with multiple-choice responses from which a respondent will choose. How satisfied are you with our level of service? Not satisfied at all Fairly satisfied Very satisfied What is the colour of your eyes? Brown Green Blue Other 1. Write a suitable question with multiple-choice responses to find out the following information: (a) What do teenagers spend their money on? (b) How much time do Grade 8s spend on homework every day? CHAPTER 18: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 201 A respondent is a person who responds to the questions. 2. Choose one of the questions from question 1 on page 201. Write down what you think would be the best sample to use if you had to conduct this investigation. 3. Use the multiple-choice question that you chose in question 2 to collect the data. Keep the results for the nextsection. 18.2 Organising data The way we organise and summarise data depends on the kind of data that we have. It also depends on what we want to find out from the data. Work in groups to explore this. Do not worry about getting the answers right at this stage. You will learn about the different ways in which to organise and summarise data in this chapter. Look at the following sets of data. For each one, discuss with your group and write down what you want to find out and what you think you would need to do to the data. 1. Data collected to find out which day would be best to have a soccer club practice: Twenty-five learners’ preferred day for soccer practice 2.

We revise these two ways of organising data here. We can use tally tables to record data in different categories. We draw a tally mark ( | ) for each item we count. We group tally marks in groups of five to count them quickly. A stem-and-leaf display is a way of listing numerical data. If the numbers in a set of data consist of digits for tens and units (such as 23, 25, 34), the column on the right (the leaf column) shows the units digits of the numbers, and the column on the left (the stem column) shows the tens digits of the numbers. Let’s see how to display these numbers using the stem-and-leaf method: 12, 13, 20, 34, 35, 47, 49, 51, 53, 53, 53, 56, 59 The numbers range from 12 to 59, so the first digits represent the numbers 10 to 50. Key: 1 | 2 means 12 stem leaves Values with the same stem are written in the same row. different leaves with the same 1 2, 3 s tem are separated by a space 2 0 3 4, 5 4 7, 9 5 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9 or a comma. In the first row, 1 | 2, 3 shows 12 and 13. The stem column shows the tens digit of each value. The leaf column shows the units digit of each value. 1. Look back at the three sets of data on page 202. Copy and fill in the table on page 204 to show which form of data organisation you can use for each of these. Write a short explanation. CHAPTER 18: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 203 Notice that the stem-and-leaf display also shows us what the data set looks like. We can quickly see that most numbers are in the 50s and that there is only one number in the 20s. If the numbers in a data set consist of three digits (such as 324, 428, 526), both the hundreds and tens digits are written in the stem column and the units digits arewritten in the leafcolumn, for example: 32 | 4 would show 324.

(a) Decide whether a tally table or a stem-and-leaf display will organise the data best, and record the data. (b) What does your tally table or stem-and-leaf display show about your data? grouping data in intervals When there are many values in a data set, it is often useful to group the data items into class intervals. Example This is a grouped frequency table. It represents 90 data values, but the values themselves are not shown. Instead, we show the frequency or the number of values falling into that interval. 1. The table shows the body weights (in kilograms) of athletes competing in a tournament. 55,2 56,1 58,4 59,3 60,6 61,2 61,7 63,4 63,2 64,2 65,9 66,5 66,7 67,3 67,8 68,0 70,5 72,9 73,4 74,1 74,8 75,9 76,7 78,7 (a) Group the weights into 5 kg intervals.

CHAPTER 18: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 205 The class interval does not include the highest number in each case.

Explain. 18.3 Summarising data: measures of central tendency and dispersion one number speaks for many: the mode and the median 1. A farmer wants to know whether he used good quality seed when he planted pumpkins. So he counts the number of pumpkins on each of a sample of 20 pumpkin plants. The numbers of pumpkins are given below: 6 7 3 7 4 7 7 8 7 5 7 7 6 7 8 5 4 7 6 7 20 25 24 33 13 26 10 19 39 31 11 16 21 17 11 34 14 15 21 18 17 38 16 21 25 206 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 (a) Arrange the data values from smallest to biggest, to get a clearer picture. (b) The farmer says to his wife: Mostof the plantshave seven pumpkins, soit isnot too bad. Do you think this is a good summary of the data, or should the farmer give some more information? In some data sets some values or items are repeated often. The value or item that occurs most often is called the mode. Some data sets have more than one mode, and many data sets have none. (c) Do you think that if the farmer had said the following, his wife would be somewhat better informed about the pumpkin plants? The number of pumpkins varies from three to eight, but there are seven pumpkins on most of the plants. 2. Look at the Mathematics test results, out of 30, of a small class of 21 learners: 15 7 11 7 13 4 8 9 3 7 25 7 6 10 8 9 23 19 7 5 7 Bongile scored 9 out of 30 in the test, which is poor. Can he claim that his mark is in the top half of the class? Explain your answer well. A set of data can be separated into a top half and a bottom half by arranging the data items from smallest to largest and finding the number between the two halves. For example, the following data set: 23 35 44 21 28 32 38 41 39 42 24 27 ... can be rearranged like this: bottom half top half The number that sits halfway between the upper item in the bottom half and the lower item in the top half in this case is 33,5 (calculation: [32 + 35] ÷ 2 = 33,5). The number that separates a set of data into an upper half and a lower half is called the median. Half of the items are above the median and half of the items are below the median. To find the median, the data items need to be arranged from smallest to largest. If a numerical data set has an odd number of items, the median is equal to the number in the middle of the set, when the items are arranged from smallest to largest: 3 4 5 6 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 11 13 15 19 23 25 3. Write down any 11 different numbers so that the median is 24. CHAPTER 18: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA 207 21 23 24 27 28 32 35 38 39 41 42 44 Instead of “most often” we can also say “most frequently”. 4. The body weights of 25 children are given below, all rounded off to the nearest 0,5 kg. This data was collected to find out whether five-year-old children in a certain village have healthy body weights or not. 17 16,5 13,5 14 18 18 14 21 13,5 15 15 14,5 15,5 19,5 17 17,5 14 14 20 14,5 16 18 12 16 19 Rearrange these data items into a bottom half and a top half, and state what the median body weight is. 5. (a) Does the data set shown above question 2 on page 207 have a mode, and if it has what is it? (b) What is the mode of the data set in question 2 on page 204? if they were all equal ... but they are not 1. Five chickens are placed on a scale and the scale shows 6,500 kg, which is the same as 6 500 g. What can you say if someone asks you: What does each of the chickens weigh? 2. A roadside stall owner has ten watermelons to sell. They are not all of the same size and he did not pay the farmer the same price for each watermelon. So the stall owner weighs the watermelons and decides to sell them at the following prices: R16 R16 R18 R15 R14 R14 R16 R14 R13 R14 (a) Check whether you agree that he will get R150 for the ten watermelons together. (b) The stall owner now decides to make the prices of all the watermelons the same, to simplify advertising and selling. What should he make the price of each watermelon, if he still wants to receive R150 for all of them together? 3. Susan bought six pumpkins at the market. Her husband, Abraham, asks her what she paid for each pumpkin. Susan says: They actually came at different prices, and I have forgotten the prices now. But I know I paid R72 in total so it would have been the same if I paid R12 each. So you can say that on average I paid R12 each. (a) Check if Susan’s answer to her husband is correct. The actual prices she paid for the different pumpkins are given below: R7 R15 R10 R16 R9 R15 208 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 (b) How do you think Susan came to the R12 she used when she answered her husband’s question? (c) Check if Susan’s answer would have been correct if the actual prices of the pumpkins were as follows: R11 R12 R13 R11 R12 R13 When she gave an answer to her husband’s question, Susan used the number 12 as a “summary” to represent the six different numbers 7; 15; 10; 16;9 and 15. The number 12 is a good representation of 7; 15; 10; 16; 9 and 15 together because: 7 + 15 + 10 + 16 + 9 + 15 = 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 If each value in a data set is replaced by the same number and the total remains the same, the “replacement number” is called the mean or average. It can be calculated by dividing the total (sum) of the values by the number of values in the data set: Mean = sum of values ÷ number of values. (In the example above, the mean is 72 ÷ 6 = 12.) Like the median, the mean (average) may not be equal to any of the actual values in the data set. 4. Look again at question 1 on page 208 about the five chickens. If you want to now give a different answer than before, write it down. 5. A journalist investigated the price of white bread at different stores in two large cities. The prices are given in cents at ten different shops in each city: City A: 927 885 937 889 861 904 899 888 839 880 City B: 890 872 908 910 942 924 900 872 933 948 (a) If youjustlook at the abovedata,do you think one can saythat white breadis cheaper in the one city than in the other? Look carefully, and give reasons for your answer. (b) Calculate the mean price of white bread for the sample in each of the two cities. (c) Find the median bread price in the sample for each of the two cities. 6. Geoffrey is a stock famer. He buys 21 goats at a mean price of R830 each. (a) How much do the 21 goats cost, in total?

Two samples were taken from the eggs produced on two different egg farms, to investigate the masses of the eggs coming from the two farms. The mean mass of the eggs from farm A is 50,6 g and the median mass is 52,0 g. The mean mass of the eggs from farm B is 50,3 g and the median mass is 52,0 g. (a) Do these figures indicate that the eggs from the two farms are similar, or that they differ? (b) The actual masses of the eggs in the two samples are given below. Check whether the mean and median masses given above are correct. Masses of the sample of eggs from farm A, in grams: 51 54 45 53 49 54 55 46 54 45 Masses of the sample of eggs from farm B, in grams: 53 52 55 44 57 41 59 43 47 52 (c) In what way do the masses of the eggs from the two farms differ? The range of a set of data is the difference between the maximum (highest or top value) and the minimum (lowest or bottom value). The values in the data set below vary from 36 to 60, hence the range is 60 − 36 = 24: 36 36 39 39 43 45 46 47 52 52 53 55 57 60 2.

These two sets of data show the prices of houses that have been sold in Towns A and B in one month: Town A: R321 000 R299 000 R405 000 R199 000 R248 000 R380 000 R181 000 R283 000 R322 000 R303 000 R315 000 Town B: R88 000 R107 000 R151 000 R122 000 R105 000 R1 199 000 R175 000 R1 114 000 R146 000 R166 000 R100 000 (a) Read through the prices in each list and write down anything that comes to your mind when you look at the two sets of figures. (b) You have been asked by the local newspaper to write a short paragraph on the prices of houses in the two towns. You want to make it quick and easy for the readers to get some sense of the prices in the two towns. Write your newspaper paragraph neatly. The mean price for houses in the list for Town A is R296 000. This is very close to the median of R303 000. All the prices in Town A are within R115 000 of the mean. The mean price for houses in the list for Town B is R315 727,which is more than double the median price of R146 000. Nine of the 11 houses in Town B cost far less than the mean, while the prices in Town A are more evenly spread on both sides of the mean. 4. Someone asks you about the house prices in Towns A and B, and you say: The mean house price in Town A is R296 000, and the mean house price in Town B is R315 727. (a) Does this statement provide good information about the difference in pricing of houses in the two towns? In what way may it actually be misleading? (b) What causes the mean to be a misleading way of describing the data for the house prices in Town B? Data items like the house prices of R1 114000 and R1 199 000 in the list for Town B in question 3 are called outliers (or extreme values). Outliers are data values that are much lower or much higher than any other values in the data set. The mean is not a good way to summarise a set of data with outliers. 5. (a) Is there an outlier in this set of monthly salaries of the employees at a small business? R8 000 R2 500 R75 000 R6 000 R7 500 R5 200 R4 800 R10 300 R15 000 R9 500 (b) Would the median prices of the two data sets be a good way to indicate the main difference between house prices in Towns A and B in question 3?

Each class interval is used for a range of values. The different class intervals are consecutive and cannot have values that overlap. The data may result from counting or from measurement. A histogram looks somewhat like a bar graph, but histograms are normally drawn without gaps between the bars. 214 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 Example Look at the following numbers of oranges harvested from 60 trees in an orchard: 830 102 57 726 400 710 333 361 295 674 927 945 276 792 787 765 540 785 305 104 88 203 224 974 852 716 790 145 755 661 728 637 319 221 766 764 397 734 856 775 330 659 211 918 345 360 518 822 818 727 346 279 804 478 626 324 478 471 69 462 The frequencies of trees with numbers of oranges in specific class intervals are shown in the following table: Lets look at how this data is then represented in the form of a histogram: The frequencies of trees bearing oranges in class intervals 20 15 10 5 0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 Number of oranges from a tree CHAPTER 19: REPRESENT dATA 215 We follow the convention that the top value (alsocalled the upper boundary) of each class interval is not included in the interval.

Draw the two graphs that you named in question 2. CHAPTER 19: REPRESENT dATA 221 20.1 Critically analysing how data is collected Data collection methods can sometimes result in bias and misleading data. This is not always intended by the researcher – it often happens when the source of the data was not carefully checked, or the method of collecting data has not been planned carefully. In Chapter 18 you learnt that a sample must be large enough to be representative and must be randomly selected from the population. If data is collected from only one part of a population, it could be biased towards that part. The researcher has to be aware of all the places where bias could occur, and should design the data-handling process so that it does not happen. When you read reported statistics, always be aware that you need information about how the data was collected, when it was collected and how the sample was chosen. Data can change over time, so you should also be aware of when it was collected. This information should be given in any report on data. data sources and collection methods 1. Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that follow: A recent study revealed that 50% of high school learners smoke cigarettes, 45% drink alcohol and 60% abuse drugs. This is an indication of the general poor health and social problems of the teenage population in our country. (a) Do you agree that the figures are high enough to conclude that the habits of these teenagers are unhealthy? (b) Can we tell the following from the data above? • What was the sample of this study? • Where was the data collected? • When was the data collected? (c) If the sample consisted of ten teenagers all located in an area known for drug and alcohol abuse, would the data be a good reflection of all teenagers in the country? Chapter 20 Interpret, analyseand report on data 222 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 (d) Describe what you think would be a better sample. (e) Why is it important to know the date of when this data set was collected? 2. The following pie charts show the toilet facilities in households in South Africa.

(e) What can you conclude from the data in Pie chart B? (f) How could the year of data collection account for the differences in the data? (g) The graph at the bottom of the previous page shows the same data as the two pie charts. Does the diagram of the pie charts or the double bar graph allow us to compare the two sets of data more easily? (h) Do the pie charts or the double bar graph show the percentage of types of toilet facilities used in South Africa better? 20.2 Critically analysing how data is represented Graphs do not always show what they seem to show at first glance! If you look a bit closer, you might see that they are misleading you into drawing an incorrect conclusion. Work through the following activity to see how this can happen. manipulation in data presentation These graphs show the average temperatures recorded in the same place, at the same time.

Do both graphs show exactly the same data? 2. Why do the graphs look sodifferent? 3. Which of the graphs would people use to emphasise that there are big differences in the temperatures over the years? Explain your answer. 4. Suggest a way to change the vertical scale of Graph A to emphasise even more that there are no big differences between the temperatures over the years. 5. Write a short report on Graph A. Also include a prediction of the temperatures in Years 8 and 9. 224 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 Average temperature (°C) 17 20.3 Critically analysing summary statistics It is sometimes necessary to inform another person about a set of data that you have worked on. In doing that, you may want to save the other person from having to look at all the values in the data set. You also want to emphasise some aspects of the data. It is for these purposes that we use summary statistics like the following: • measures of central tendency (typical values): mode, median and mean • measures of dispersion (values indicating the spread of data): the smallest and largest values and the difference between them (the range) Summary statistics do not provide full information on data. Some information is always lost and so summary statistics can be misleading, especially if there are outliers; in other words, values that differ a lot from the majority of the values. how summary statistics can be misleading 1. The manager of a small business is asked what monthly salaries his employees get. His answer: The mean of the salaries is R13 731. (a) Do you think the manager’s answer is a good description of the salaries? (b) In order to have some sense of the salaries paid at the firm, which one of the following would you prefer to know: the median, the mode, the rangeor the lowest and highest salaries? 2. The actual monthly salaries of the 13 staff members in the small business from question 1 are given below: R3 500 R3 500 R3 500 R3 500 R3 500 R4 200 R4 200 R4 200 R4 400 R12 000 R28 000 R44 000 R60 000 In what ways may you be misinformed if you do not know the above figures, but only know that the mean salary is R13 731? 3. If only one summary statistic is used to provide information about the salaries at the firm, which of the following do you think would be the best to give? Give reasons for your choice. A. the mode B. the range C. the median D. the lowest and highest salaries 4. Look at the different monthly salaries of employees at another small business: R34 000 R35 000 R3 400 R31 000 R32 000 225 CHAPTER 20: INTERPRET, ANALYSE ANd REPORT ON dATA (a) Why would the mean not be a good way to summarise this data? (b) Calculate the mean salary. 5. The following data shows the number of boxes of chocolates sold by a store in ten consecutive months: 42 38 179 40 43 40 48 39 41 42 (a) Which would be the better summary description of the data, the mean or the median? Explain your answer. (b) Write a good summary description of the data without using the median. (c) Would it make sense to leave out the outlier, 179, when calculating the mean of the monthly sales? Explain your answer. manipulation in summary reports on data The mode, median and mean each highlight different bits of information about the same set of data. They can be very different from one another, depending on the kind of data set you have. Sometimes people choose the statistic that does not show the typical values, but rather the value that works best forthem. 1. Thivha sells restored furniture. He reports that he usuallysells seven items per week, and that he has the data to prove it. The receipts show that he made 52 sales over a period of eight weeks. (a) Can you tell from the data above whether Thivha is truthful or not about the sales? (b) You examined the receipts for the eight weeks closely, and find the following number of sales per week: 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 22 Determine the mode and median of the data set. (c) Do you think the mode, median or mean is a better reflection of Thivha’s typical sales figures per week? Explain your answer. 2. The following data shows the amount of pocket money that a group of learners receives per week: R0 R0 R5 R10 R10 R10 R10 R20 R20 R50 (a) Determine the mode, median, mean and range of the data set. (b) The teenager who receives R5 a week wants to convince her parents to give her more money. Which of the summary statistics would she use? Explain your answer. (c) Which summary statistic do you think best represents the weekly pocket money in this group of learners? Explain your answer. 226 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 3 Chapter 21 Functions and relationships 21.1 Calculating output values formulae and tables The statement y = 2x + 6 can be true for any value of x, provided one chooses the appropriate value of y.

Write the rule in the form of a formula. Represent the number of trees with the letter symbol y. (b) Write a formula for finding the number of orange trees after x days. (c) How many orange trees are there on the fourteenth day? (d) After how many days will Farmer Moola have 260 apple trees? After how many days will farmer Moola have 1 000 apple trees in his orchard? It will take some time to work this out by counting in twenties. You can easily make a mistake and not even be aware of it. Another way to find the information is to figure out for which value of x it will be true that 100 + 20x = 1 000. To do this you may try different values for x until you find the value that makes 100 + 20x equal to 1 000. It is convenient to enter the results in a table as shown below. Anna first tried x = 10 and saw that 10 is far too small. She next tried x = 100 and it was far too big. She then tried 50.

Use a letter symbol of your own choice to represent the unknown number of days. solving equations by inspection Tosolve an equation means to find the value(s) of the unknown for which an expression has a given value. One method of solving an equation is to try different values of the variable until you find a value for which the expression is equal to the given value, or for which the two expressions have the same value. This is called solving by inspection. CHAPTER 22: ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 237 6 The value of the variable for which an expression is equal to a given value, or for which two expressions have the same value, is called the solution or the root of the equation. 1. In each case, determine whether the value of x given in brackets is a root or solution of the equation or not. Justify your answer, in other words, say why you think the number is or is not a root of the equation. In cases where the given number is not a root or solution, find the solution by trying other values.

What is the multiplicative inverse of each of the following? Explain. (a) 5 (b) −5 (c) 5 (d) 1 You can solve the equation 2x + 5 = 45 in the following way: 2x + 5 = 45 2x+ 5 − 5 = 45 − 5 Subtract 5 from both sides to have only the term in x This step can also be understood as 5 + (−5) = 0 2x + 0 = 40 2x = 40 2 2 x = 20 Divide both sides by 2 to have x only This step can also be understood as 2 × 1 = 1 2 3.

Solution: 2 x = 2 3 [Write 8 in terms of base 2, i.e. as a power of 2] x = 3 [2 raised to the power of 3 is 8] Solving exponential equations is the same as asking the question: Towhich power must the base be raised for the equation to be true? 1. Solve for x: (a) 4 x = 64 (b) 3 x = 27 (c) 6 x = 216 (d) 5 x = 125 (e) 2 x = 32 (f) 12 x = 144 Example 2: Solve the equation 2 x + 1 = 8. Solution: 2 x + 1 = 2 3 x + 1 = 3 x = 2 2.

A quantity can change in the following ways: • It can increase or decrease. • It can increase at a constant rate, for example the total amount saved if the same amount is saved every week ormonth. • It can decrease at a constant rate, for example the length of a burning candle. • It can increase (or decrease) at a varying rate, for example the increase in the area of a square as the side length increases. When a quantity increases or decreases at a constant rate, it is called linear change or variation, and the graph is a straight line. When the rate of change is not constant, it is called non- linear change, and the graph is curved. If there is no change in the output variable, the graph is a horizontal straight line. 1. Draw a graph to match each of the following descriptions: (a) The quantity increases, and increases more rapidly as time progresses. (b) The quantity first increases slowly at a constant rate, and then increases at a faster, constant rate. (c) The quantity decreases faster and faster. (d) The quantity increases, and the rate of increase gradually diminishes. CHAPTER 23: GRAPHS 245 Mass (in kg) 2.

(c) The price decreased at a constant rate. (d) The price dropped very fast at first and then at a slower rate. (e) The price rose at a decreasing rate up to a point and then started to drop at an increasing rate. A B C D E 3.

A graph has a minimum value when it changes from decreasing to increasing. A graph can have more than one minimum or maximum value. 1. Consider the graphs below. Describe how the dependent variable behaves in each case by indicating which graph corresponds to which description. (a) The variable has a maximum value because it changes from increasing to decreasing. (b) The variable has a minimum value because it changes from decreasing to increasing. (c) The variable has a maximum value as well as a minimum value because it changes from increasing to decreasing and then from decreasing to increasing. Graph 1 Graph 2 Graph 3 2.

Say if the following make sense or not. Explain. (a) 501,3 learners attended a rugby match played by the senior team. (b) The distance from school to the nearest shopping mall is 10,75 km. (c) 2 004,75 cans of cola were sold during a fundraising event. Quantitative data is numerical data such as a person’s marks in a Mathematics test. Quantities that can be counted are sometimes said to be discrete: they do not allow values in between any two consecutive values. You cannot have 2,6 people for example. Quantities that allow many values between any two values are sometimes said to be continuous. 23.3 Drawing graphs drawing global graphs When we draw a graph of continuous data, it is a solid line or curve. The graph of discrete data is a set of distinct points. 248 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 The terms “discrete” and “continuous” are used in different meanings than these in formal mathematics.

The first number in a pair represents the input number and the second number represents the output number. We therefore say that the pair of numbers is ordered. Making a graph of ordered pairs is another way to show how the input and output values are related. When drawing a graph of ordered pairs, work as follows: • First identify the input values (x) and output values (y). In most cases the input values will be given and the output values are calculated using the formula given. • The output values are written on the y-axis (the vertical axis) and the input values are written on the x-axis (the horizontalaxis). • Plot the ordered pair. Suppose the ordered pair is (3; 6). Toplot this pair, put your finger on the number 3 on the x-axis and another finger on the number 6 on the y-axis. Move your finger on the number 3 in a line straight up and move your finger on the number 6 straight across. Where your two fingers meet, make a point. You can describe this point with the ordered pair (3; 6). 1. On graph paper plot the ordered pairs given below: (a) A(0; 3) (b) B(3; 0) (c) C(−2; 1) (d) D(4; −4) (e) E(−3; −2) 2.

A figure can be moved from one position to another on a flat surface by sliding (translating), turning (rotating) or flipping it over (reflecting), or by a combination of such movements. These and other kinds of movements are also called transformations. B C A slide can also be performed in steps, as indicated by the green arrows. You may also think of folding the paper over on the dotted line. ' B' C' B' The object is swung (rotated) clockwise or anticlockwise around A' a point called the C' centre of rotation. (It is as if you hold the object on a string.) Chapter 24 Transformation geometry A flip-over is also called a reflection. 254 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 B A swingor turn is also called a rotation. A slide is also called a translation. ' C' B' B C In its new position, the figure is called the image of the original figure. In the diagrams on page 254, the original figures are blue and the images are yellow. Slides, turns and flips do not change the shape or size of a figure. Hence, in these transformations, the original figure and its image are always congruent. To name the image, we use the same letters as in the original figure, but we add the prime symbol (') after each letter. For example, the image of ∆ABC is ∆A'B'C'. If there is a second image, we add two prime symbols, for example ∆A''B''C''. If there is a third image, we use three prime symbols, for example ∆A'''B'''C''', and so on. A'' C'' B'' ''' B C ' B'' C''' B' C' The grid in the background makes it possible to describe the different positions of the figure clearly. To do that, a system of axes can be drawn on the grid to form a coordinate system, as you will see on the next page. But first, answer the question below. In each case, state whether the triangle was translated, reflected or rotated: 1. 2. 3. 4. CHAPTER 24: TRANSFORMATION GEOMETRY 255 A coordinate system consists of numbered horizontal and vertical lines that are used to describe position. 5. 6. coordinate systems The position of any point on a system of coordinates can be described by two numbers, as demonstrated below for the points A, B, C and D. The horizontal axis on the coordinate system is called the x-axis and the vertical axis is called the y-axis. The ordered pair (4; 3) indicates that the value of the x-coordinate is 4 and the value of the y-coordinate is 3. A coordinate system is divided into four sections called quadrants. 1.

In the diagram:GE = G'E; FC = F'C and HD = H'D. • The line that connects the original point to its image point is always perpendicular (⊥) to the line of reflection. In the diagram: HH' ⊥ line of reflection, FF' ⊥ line of reflection and GG' ⊥ line of reflection. • When a figure is reflected, the figure and its image are congruent. A line of reflection can run in any direction. This year, you will learn about reflections in the x-axis or in the y-axisonly. reflecting points in the x-axis or in the y-axis Reflecting a point in the x-axis means that the x-axis is the line of reflection.

The angle that is formed between the line connecting an original point (S or P or R) to the centre of rotation A and the line connecting the image point (S', P', R') to the centre of rotation is equal to the angle of rotation.

The yellow figure is The green figure is a reduction of the an enlargement blue quadrilateral. of the blue quadrilateral. A figure is only called an enlargement or reduction of another figure if the two figures have the same shape. The shapes can only be the same if all the corresponding angles are equal. Even if the angles are equal, two figures may have different shapes. When the corresponding angles are equal, one figure is not necessarily an enlargement or reduction of the other. Although the angles are equal, the yellow and green figures above are not enlargements of the blue figure. 264 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 When a figure with straight sides is enlarged or reduced, the lengths of the sides are increased or decreased. To find the lengths of the sides of the new figure, the lengths of the sides of the original figure are all multiplied by the same number. This number is called the scale factor of the enlargement or reduction. 1. On grid paper, draw a bigger rectangle ABCD, with each side five times as long as the blue rectangle. Also draw another bigger rectangle PQRS, with each side five units longer than the blue rectangle. One figure is only called an enlargement or reduction of another figure if the corresponding angles are equal and the ratio between the lengths of the corresponding sides is the same, for all pairs of corresponding angles and sides in the two figures. This is demonstrated below. The green rectangle on the right is an enlargement of the blue rectangle. The orange rectangle is a reduction of the blue rectangle. In the following two diagrams, the same rectangles are shown on grids so that it is easy to compare the lengths of the corresponding sides and calculate the ratio between the lengths of thesides. K L E F A B D C H G N M CHAPTER 24: TRANSFORMATION GEOMETRY 265 The scale factor for an enlargement is bigger than 1. The scale factor fora reduction is smaller than 1. 18 cm To avoid confusion, mathematicians normally state the dimensions of the image first when forming ratios. 2 KLMN is an enlargement of EFGH. Note that LM = 8 : 4 = 2, MN = 12 : 6 = 2, NK FG GH HE = 8 : 4 = 2 and KL EF = 12 : 6 = 2. The ratio between the lengths of corresponding sides is 2, for all four pairs of corresponding sides. We say: The scale factor of the enlargement from EFGH to KLMN is 2. ABCD is a reduction of EFGH. Note that BC = 2 : 4 = 1 , CD = 3: 6 = 1 , DA = 2 : 4 = 1 and AB = 3 : 6 = 1 . FG 2 GH 2 HE 2 1 EF 2 The ratio between the lengths of corresponding sides is , for all four pairs of corresponding sides. The scale factor of the reduction from EFGH to ABCD is 1 . 2 2. (a) What is the scale factor of the enlargement from ABCD to KLMN? (b) What is the scale factor of the reduction from KLMN to EFGH? 3. A rectangular shape on a photograph is 3 mm wide and 4 mm long. The photograph is enlarged with a scale factor of 5. What is the width and length of the rectangular shape on the enlarged photograph? We work out the scale factor by calculating the ratios of the lengths of corresponding sides of the two figures. If the ratios are equal, we say that the corresponding sides are in proportion. This means that the second figure (the image) is a reduction or an enlargement of the first figure (the original). 4. Determine whether the second figure in each of the following pairs is an enlargement, a reduction, or neither of the two. Also work out the perimeters of both figures.

Some objects, like a saucepan or other cooking vessel, have both round and flat surfaces. The circular bottom of a saucepan must be flat so that it makes good contact with the stove plate. 1. (a) Should the top of a table or desk be a flat or curved surface? (b) We eat with knives, forks and spoons. Which of these objects normally have curved surfaces? This chapter is about objects that only have flat surfaces, like those shown below. The front, right and top faces in the above drawing are made of clear plastic so that you can see the faces behind them. Note this strange box with different colours on its different faces. 2. Do you think there is enough space for all the birds in the tent shown on the right-hand side? 269 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS B F 3. The unusual box, shown on the previous page, with flat faces (surfaces) only is shown again below. In the drawing of the same box on the right, dotted lines are used to indicate edges and surfaces that are hidden in the coloured drawing. (a) How many faces (different flat surfaces) does this object have altogether? (b) How many faces cannot be seen in the coloured drawing on the left? (c) How many of the faces are rectangles? (d) How many of the faces are pentagons? A 3D object with flat faces (surfaces) only is called a polyhedron (plural: polyhedra). A straight edge is formed where two flat surfaces meet. The point where two or more edges meet is called a vertex (plural: vertices). 4. (a) How many edges does the coloured polyhedron in question 3 have? (b) How many vertices does it have? 5. Which of the objects below are polyhedra? A C D E G 270 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 The word polyhedron means “many-seated” and describes the shape of such an object with many flat faces. two special types of polyhedra PolyhedralikeCandE atthebottom oftheprevious page arecalled prisms. Polyhedra like B and G are called pyramids. 1. Describe the differences between prisms and pyramids. Here are some more pictures of prisms: B C E F The objects shown by the four pictures below are polyhedra but they are not prisms or pyramids. G H I J 271 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS A D Here are some pictures of pyramids. More pictures of pyramids are shown at the bottom of this page and also on the next page. L M N A prism has two identical, parallel faces (called bases) that are connected by parallelograms (called lateral faces). In the case of right prisms, the lateral faces are perpendicular to the bases and the lateral faces are rectangles. A prism with pentagonal bases like this one is called a pentagonal prism because the base is a pentagon. 2. (a) Which pictures on the previous page also show pentagonal prisms? (b) Which picture on the previous page shows a hexagonal prism? (c) Which picture on the previous page shows an octagonal prism? A pyramid has only one base. The lateral faces of a pyramid are triangles that meet at the apex. The pyramid on the right is called a hexagonal-based pyramid. Thetwopyramids belowhavequadrilaterals asbasesandare called quadrilateral-based pyramids. 3. Which picture at the top of this page shows a hexagonal pyramid? A triangular-based pyramid is also called a triangular pyramid; a square-based pyramid is also called a square pyramid; a hexagonal-based pyramid is also called a hexagonal pyramid, etc. 272 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 K Pictures of different square-based pyramids are shown below. 273 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS You can make a square-based pyramid by drawing and cutting out a diagram like the one on the left below, and folding the triangles up on the dotted lines, as shown on the right. These men are building a triangular-based pyramid: A triangular-based pyramid is also called a tetrahedron, which literally means “four-face”. A tetrahedron with four identical faces that are equilateral triangles is called a regular tetrahedron. If you copy and cut out a figure like the one on the right, and fold the triangles up on the dotted lines, you can make a regular tetrahedron. A diagram like this, that can be cut out and folded to make a model of a polyhedron, is called a net. 274 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 A regular polyhedron has identical faces that are regular polygons; that is, with all sides and angles equal. A rectangular prism is also called a cuboid. A cuboid with square faces is also called a cube. An object with two identical circular bases and one curved surface is called a cylinder. A “pyramid” with a round base is called a cone. An object with the shape of a ball, in other words one curved surface with every point on its surface the same distance from its centre, is called a sphere. Cylinders, cones and spheres are not polyhedra since they have curved surfaces. Remember, a polyhedron has faces, edges and vertices. The faces are the flat surfaces. An edge is a line along which two faces of a 3D object meet, and connects two vertices. A vertex is the point where the edges meet. 4. Write down and name the labels for parts (a) to (f) on the following figure: (f) (e) (a) (d) (b) Triangular prism 5. Grade 8 learners made 3D objects from cardboard. Can you say which kind of figure the following three learners made? (a) Adam’s object had eight vertices and 12 edges. (b) Lea’s object had four vertices and four faces. (c) Mary’s object had 12 edges and six congruent faces. 275 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS (c) 6. Copy and complete the table for prisms. Count the bases as faces too. If you find this difficult, it may help you to make quick rough sketches of nets for some prisms, like the sketches given below the table.

Consider your answers for questions 6 and 7. Is the following statement true for both prisms and pyramids? Statement: The number of faces + the number of vertices = 2 + the number of edges 9. Is Euler’s formula true for the polyhedra G, H, I and J on page 271? This statement is called euler’s formula for polyhedra. 25.2 Nets and models of prisms and pyramids a quick way to make prisms and pyramids Fold sections about two fingers wide on a sheet of A4 paper, more or less as shown by the dotted lines in the sketch on the right. Fold the sheet into a “tube” with five or six faces along its length, as shown below. With a little extra work, you can now make a paper prism. You need to cut out two bases so that they fit well. You can make prisms with triangular, square, rectangular, hexagonal and other shaped bases in this way. You can make a pyramid in the same way, but it is more difficult. Draw dotted lines on a sheet of A4 paper, as shown in the sketch on the right. Fold the paper along the dotted lines. It is quite difficult to know where and how to cut so that the base is a flatsurface. Apart from the difficulty of getting the base of the pyramid flat, the above method has the disadvantage that you have to use separate pieces of paper or other material to make one object. It would be better to make the whole object by folding one piece of paper. For example, a prism with a pentagonal base can be made by drawing, cutting out and folding a sheet of paper, as shown on the left. This diagram is called a net of a prism with a regular pentagonal base. 277 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS nets for different polyhedra 1.

You may have to take measurements to be sure in some cases, or make a copy and cut the diagram out and fold it. In each case where you say no, explain why you think it will not work. 1. 2. 288 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 3. 4. 289 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS circles and pyramids In order to meet at the apex, one side of each triangular face of a pyramid must be the same length as the closest side of the triangle next to it. This means that certain line segments in the net of a pyramid must be equal. 1. Trace the diagram below. Mark the line segments that should be equal in the diagram, so that a pyramid can be made by folding a cut-out of the diagram on the dotted lines. 2. Make an accurate copy of the above diagram on stiff paper or cardboard. Cut it out and fold along the dotted lines. See if you can make a pyramid in this way. 290 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 Any polygon can form the base of a pyramid. If you want to draw a net for a pyramid, you can start by drawing a polygon. Then draw any triangle on one side of the polygon. The triangles that will be adjacent to the first one must each have one side equal to the matching side of the first triangle, as indicated with the solid and dotted red and blue line segments in the sketch on the right. The dotted line segments can be in other positions too, as long as they have the same lengths as the coloured sides of the first triangle. This means that once the first triangular face is drawn, there are many different possibilities for each of the two triangles that will be adjacent to it on the pyramid. The circle with the red dot as midpoint, on the sketch on the right, shows the possibilities for one triangular face. Once a triangle on the upper edge of the base is chosen, a circle can be drawn around the green vertex to indicate the possibilities for the third triangular face. The radius of this circle is the length of the second leg of the second triangle, shown in solid green on the sketch. Any line segment drawn from the green circle to the green vertex can be a side of the third triangular face. 291 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS Only one triangular face remains to be drawn now. We will refer to it as the blue triangle. The black and blue dots on the sketch show where two vertices of the blue triangle should be. 3. Copy the above sketch into your book and roughly draw the fourth triangular face for a pyramid. Think how long the sides should be so that the diagram will work precisely as a net to make a pyramid. 4. (a) How can the black dot and the green triangle help you to get some idea as to where the third vertex of the blue triangle should be? (b) How can the blue dot and the yellow triangle help you to get some idea as to where the third vertex of the blue triangle should be? 5. An enlargement of the sketch given at the top of this page is given below. Copy the enlargement into your book and use your pair of compasses to find the third vertex of the face that is not yet drawn, and complete the net for the pyramid. Then make a copy of the diagram on stiff paper or cardboard, cut it out and fold it to see if it forms a pyramid. 292 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 6. Join points on this sketch to draw a net for a pyramid. 25.3 Platonic solids making polyhedra with identical faces and equal edges A cube is a special type of polyhedron. It has six identical faces, and its 12 edges are all equal in length. 1. How many vertices does a cube have? 2. Can you think of an object which has faces that are identical triangles, and all its edges are equal? Try draw a rough sketch of the net for such an object. 3. (a) Make a copy of the diagram below. Cut it out and fold it along the dotted lines. Attach the faces with sticky tape to makean open container with pentagonal faces. 293 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS (b) Make another copy of the pentagon diagram, and make a second container. (c) Turn one of your containers upside down and put the two together to form a polyhedron. (d) How many faces does your polyhedron have? (e) Are the faces identical, and what shape are they? (f) Are the edges equally long, and how many edges are there? A polyhedron of which all the faces are identical regular polygons is called a Platonic solid, because the Greek philosopher Plato was fascinated by such objects. A regular polygon is a polygon with equal sides and equal angles. 294 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 4. Do you think the diagram below can be used as a net to make a Platonic solid? If it is possible, how many faces, how many edges and how many vertices will the polyhedron have? 5. (a) Make two accurate copies of the above diagram. Cut out on the solid lines and fold on the dotted lines to form two identical polyhedra. Polyhedra like this are called regular tetrahedra. (b) Try to combine your two regular tetrahedra to make another solid, with six faces, nine edges and five vertices. 295 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS the platonic solids The Platonic solids have special names, and these are given below. There are only five Platonic solids. A tetrahedron consists of four equilateral triangles. It has six edges and four vertices. An octahedron consists of eight equilateral triangles. It has 12 edges and six vertices. A hexahedron (also known as a cube) consists of six squares. It has 12 edges and eight vertices. A dodecahedron consists of 12 regular pentagons. It has 30 edges and 20 vertices. An icosahedron consists of 20 equilateral triangles. It has 30 edges and 12 vertices. 1. Nets for some of the Platonic solids are given on the following pages. Write the names of the objects next to the nets that can be used to make them. 2. Investigate whether Euler’s formula is true for the Platonic solids. (Euler’s formula: the number of faces + the number of vertices = 2 + the number of edges) 296 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 (a) 297 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS (b) 298 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 (c) 299 CHAPTER 25: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS 26.1 How often different things can happen different fractions of a whole number Jayden lives close to the sea.

What is the frequency for each of the following colours in answer F, in question 7 on the previous page? (a) red (b) pink (c) yellow (d) blue When the different possible outcomes of an event are equally likely, it is reasonable to expect that when the event is repeated many times, the frequencies for the different outcomes will be almost equal. CHAPTER 26: PROBABILITY 303 an investigation 1. Make eight small cards or pieces of paper. On each card write a different letter. Use the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. Put the cards in a paper bag. Imagine that you draw a card out of the bag, note the letter and put it back. Imagine that you perform 40 such trials, noting the outcome each time. Then you find the frequency for each letter. To what number do you think each of the frequencies will be close? The number you think of may be called the expected frequency. 2. What will be the expected frequencies for each letter if: (a) 200 trials are performed? (b) 1 000 trials are performed? 3. Now actually do the experiment described in question 1. Record your results with tally marks in a table like the one below. When you have finished, count the tally marks to find the actual frequencies. A B C D E F G H Tally marks Actual frequency Expected frequency 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4. Write your actual frequencies on a slip of paper, in a table like as follows: A B C D E F G H Actual frequency 5. The next step is to collect the slips of four different classmates. Copy the table on page 305, and write their frequencies in rows 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 of the table, together with your own frequencies. Do not do it yet. When you put the five sets of results together, and add them up, you will have the actual frequencies out of 200 trials. You will write these in row 16.In the row for expected frequencies, write the numbers to which you think the frequencies will be close. 6. Now work with your four classmates, and complete rows 1, 4, 7, 10and 13. 7. In the first empty row after each actual frequency row, express the frequency as a fraction of the total number of outcomes in the experiment, which was 40 in each case. You need not simplify the fractions in rows 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14 of the table. 8. In rows 17 and 20, express the frequencies of rows 16 and 19 as fractions of 200. 9. In the remaining empty rows, express the fractions as percentages. 304 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 8: TERM 4 10.

Try to explain why this is the case. 12. In which of the rows in question 10 are the numbers closest to the expected percentages in row 21?

Put your hand into the bag without looking inside, and take one button out. Check what colour it is, copy the table below and make a tally mark in the column for that colour, and put the button back into the bag. Do this ten times.

Each time, there were three possible outcomes for the trial: the button could be yellow, it could be blue or it could be red. We can also say that three different events were possible: yellow, blue and red. But if we consider the numbers on the buttons, ten different outcomes are possible. 6.

When you multiply two or more natural numbers, you get a natural number again. However, when a natural number is subtracted from another natural number, the answer is not always a natural number again. For example, there is no natural number that provides the answer to 5 – 20. Similarly, when a natural number is divided by another natural number, the answer is not always a natural number again. For example, there is no natural number that provides the answer to 10 ÷ 3. When subtraction or division is done with natural numbers, the answers are not always natural numbers. 1. (a) Is there a smallest natural number, in other words, a natural number that is smaller than all other natural numbers? If so, what is it? (b) Is there a largest natural number, in other words, a natural number that is larger than all other natural numbers? If so, what is it? 2. In each of the following cases, say whether the answer is a natural number or not: (a) 100 + 400 (b) 100 – 400 (c) 100 × 400 (d) 100 ÷ 400 Chapter 1 Whole numbers The system of natural numbers is not closed under subtraction or division. Mathematicians describe this by saying: The system of natural numbers is closed under addition and multiplication. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 2 2017/04/13 2:28:19 PM MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 1 2 The whole numbers Although we do not use 0 for counting, we need it to write numbers. Without 0, we would need a special symbol for 10, all multiples of 10 and some other numbers. For example, all the numbers that belong in the yellow cells below would need a special symbol. 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 The natural numbers combined with 0 is called the system of whole numbers. If you are working with natural numbers and you add two numbers, the answer will always be different from any of the two numbers added. For example: 21 + 25 = 46 and 24 + 1 = 25. If you are working with whole numbers, in other words including 0, this is not the case. When 0 is added to a number the answer is just the number you start with: 24 + 0 = 24. For this reason, 0 is called the identity element for addition. In the set of natural numbers there is no identity element for addition. 3. Is there an identity element for multiplication in the whole numbers? Explain your answer. 4. (a) What is the smallest natural number? (b) What is the smallest whole number? The integers In the set of whole numbers, no answer is available when you subtract a number from a number smaller than itself. For example, there is no whole number that is the answer for 5 – 8. But there is an answer to this subtraction in the system of integers. For example: 5 – 8 = −3. The number –3 is read as “negative 3” or “minus 3”. Whole numbers start with 0 and extend in one direction: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6    ...... Integers extend in both directions: ......    −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6    ...... Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 3 2017/04/13 2:28:19 PM All whole numbers are also integers. The set of whole numbers forms part of the set of integers. For each whole number, there is a negative number that corresponds with it. The negative number −5 corresponds to the whole number 5 and the negative number −120 corresponds to the whole number 120. Within the set of integers, the sum of two numbers can be 0. For example 20 + (−20) = 0 and 135 + (−135) = 0. 20 and −20 are called additive inverses of each other. 5. Calculate the following without using a calculator: (a) 100 − 165 (b) 300 − 700 6. You may use a calculator to calculate the following: (a) 123 − 765 (b) 385 − 723 The rational numbers 7. Five people share 12 slabs of chocolate equally among them. (a) Will each person get more or less than two full slabs of chocolate? (b) Can each person get another half of a slab? (c) How much more than two full slabs can each person get, if the two remaining slabs are divided as shown here? (d) Will each person get 2,4 or 2 2 slab? 5 The system of integers does not provide an answer for all possible division questions. For example, as we see above, the answer for 12 ÷ 5 is not an integer. To have answers for all possible division questions, we have to extend the number system to include fractions and negative fractions, in other words, numbers of the form integer . This system of numbers is called rational numbers. We can represent integer rational numbers as common fractions or as decimal numbers. 8. Express the answers for each of the following division problems in two ways. Firstly, using the common fraction notation and secondly, using the decimal notation for fractions. (a) 23 ÷ 10 (b) 23 ÷ 5 (c) 230 ÷ 100 (d) 8 ÷ 10 3 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 4 2017/04/13 2:28:19 PM Rational and irrational numbers together, are called real numbers. 9. Copy the table and answer the statement by writing “yes” or “no” in the appropriate cell. Statement Natural numbers Whole numbers Integers Rational numbers The sum of two numbers is a number of the same kind (closed under addition). The sum of two numbers is always bigger than either of the two numbers. When one number is subtracted from another, the answer is a number of the same kind (closed under subtraction). When one number is subtracted from another, the answer is always smaller than the first number. The product of two numbers is a number of the same kind (closed under addition). The product of two numbers is always bigger than either of the two numbers. The quotient of two numbers is a number of the same kind (closed under division). The quotient of two numbers is always smaller than the first of the two numbers. Irrational numbers Rational numbers do not provide for all situations that may occur in Mathematics. For example, there is no rational number which will produce the answer 2 when it is multiplied by itself. (number) × (same number) = 2 2 × 2 = 4 and 1 × 1 = 1, so clearly, this number must be between 1 and 2. But there is no number which can be expressed as a fraction, in either the common fraction or the decimal notation, which will solve this problem. Numbers like these are called irrational numbers. Here are some more examples of irrational numbers: π MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 1 4 5 10 3 7 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 5 2017/04/13 2:28:19 PM 1.2 Calculations with whole numbers Do not use a calculator in Section 1.2, unless told to do so. estimating, rounding off and compensating 1. A shop owner wants to buy chickens from a farmer. The farmer wants R38 for each chicken. Answer the following questions without doing written calculations: (a) If the shop owner has R10 000 to buy chickens, do you think he can buy more than 500 chickens? (b) Do you think he can buy more than 200 chickens? (c) Do you think he can buy more than 250 chickens? What you were trying to do in question 1 is called estimation. To estimate, when working with numbers, means to try to get close to an answer without actually doing the calculations. However, you can do other, simpler calculations to estimate. When the goal is not to get an accurate answer, numbers may be rounded off. For example, the cost of 51 chickens at R38 each may be approximated by calculating 50 × 40. This is clearly much easier than calculating 51 × R38. 2. (a) How much is 5 × 4? (b) How much is 5 × 40? (c) How much is 50 × 40? The cost of 51 chickens at R38 each is therefore, approximately R2 000. This approximation was obtained by rounding both 51 and 38 off to the nearest multiple of 10, and then calculating with the multiples of 10. 3. In each case, estimate the cost by rounding off to calculate the approximate cost, without using a calculator. In each case, make two estimates. First make a rough estimate by rounding the numbers off to the nearest 100 before calculating. Then make a better estimate by rounding the numbers off to the nearest 10 before calculating. (a) 83 goats are sold for R243 each (b) 121 chairs are sold for R258 each (c) R5 673 is added to R3 277 (d) R874 is subtracted from R1 234 Suppose you have to calculate R823 − R273. An estimate can be made by rounding the numbers off to the nearest 100: R800 − R300 = R500. 4. (a) By working with R800 instead of R823, an error was introduced into your answer. How can this error be corrected: by adding R23 to the R500, or by subtracting it from R500? 5 CHAPTER 1: WHOLE NUMBERS To approximate something means to try find out more or less how much it is, without measuring or calculating it precisely. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 6 2017/04/13 2:28:19 PM (b) Correct the error to get a better estimate. (c) Now also correct the error that was made by subtracting R300 instead of R273. What you did in question 4 is called compensating for errors. 5. Estimate each of the following by rounding off the numbers to the nearest 100: (a) 812 − 342 (b) 2 342 − 1 876 (c) 812 + 342 (d) 2 342 + 1 876 (e) 9 + 278 (f) 3 231 − 1 769 (g) 8 234 − 2 776 (h) 5 213 − 3 768 6. Find the exact answer for each of the calculations in question 5, by working out the errors caused by rounding, and compensating for them. adding in columns 1. (a) Write 8 000 + 1 100 + 130 + 14 as a single number. (b) Write 3 000 + 700 + 50 + 8 as a single number. (c) Write 5 486 in expanded notation, as shown in question 1(b). You can calculate 3 758 + 5 486 as shown on the left below. 3 758 3 758 5 486 5 486 Step 1 8 000 Step 2 1 100 Step 3 130 Step 4 14 9 244 You can do this in short, as shown on the right. This is a bit harder on the brain, but it saves paper! 9 244 2. Explain how the numbers in each of Steps 1 to 4 are obtained. It is only possible to use the shorter method if you add the units first, then add the tens, then the hundreds and finally, the thousands. You can then do what you did in question 1(a), without writing the separate terms of the expanded form. 3. Calculate each of the following: (a) 3 878 + 3 784 (b) 298 + 8 594 (c) 10 921 + 2 472 (d) 1 298 + 18 782 4.

If you worked correctly you should have obtained the same answers for questions 1(a) and 1(b). If this was not the case, redo your work. The expression 7 000 + 1 300 + 120 + 12 was formed from 8 000 + 400 + 30 + 2 by: • taking 1 000 away from 8 000 and adding it to the hundreds term to get 1 400 • taking 100 away from 1 400 and adding it to the tens term to get 130 • taking 10 away from 130 and adding it to the units term to get 12. 3.

Calculate the percentage loss or profit. hire purchase Sometimes you need an item but do not have enough money to pay the full amount immediately. One option is to buy the item on hire purchase (HP). You will have to pay a deposit and sign an agreement in which you undertake to pay monthly instalments until you have paid the full amount. Therefore: HP price = deposit + total of instalments The difference between the HP price and the cash price is the interest that the dealer charges you for allowing you to pay off the item over a period of time. 1.

Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 19 2017/04/13 2:28:21 PM 2.1 Which numbers are smaller than 0? why people decided to have negative numbers Numbers such as −7 and −500, the additive inverses of whole numbers, are included with all the whole numbers and are called integers. Fractions can be negative too, for example: − 3 4 and −3,46. Natural numbers are used for counting and fractions (rational numbers) are used for measuring. Why do we also have negative numbers? When a larger number is subtracted from a smaller number, the answer may be a negative number: 5 − 12 = −7. This number is called negative 7. One of the most important reasons for inventing negative numbers was to provide solutions for equations like the following: Equation Solution Required property of negative numbers 17 + x = 10 x = −7 because 17 + (−7) = 17 − 7 = 10 1. Adding a negative number is just like subtracting the corresponding positive number 5 − x = 9 x = −4 because 5 − (−4) = 5 + 4 = 9 2. Subtracting a negative number is just like adding the corresponding positive number 20 + 3x = 5 x = −5 because 3 × (−5) = −15 3. The product of a positive number and a negative number is a negative number properties of integers 1. In each case, state what number will make the equation true. Also state which of the properties of integers in the table above, is demonstrated by the equation: (a) 20 − x = 50 (b) 50 + x = 20 (c) 20 − 3x = 50 (d) 50 + 3x = 20 Chapter 2 Integers 19 CHAPTER 2: INTEGERS Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 20 2017/04/13 2:28:21 PM 2.2 Adding and subtracting with integers Addition and subtraction of negative numbers Examples: (−5) + (−3) and (−20) − (−7) This is done in the same way as the addition and subtraction of positive numbers. (−5) + (−3) = −8 and −20 − (−7) = −13 This is just like 5 + 3 = 8 and 20 − 7 =13, or R5 + R3 = R8, and R20 − R7 = R13. Subtraction of a larger number from a smaller number Examples: 5 − 9 and 29 − 51 Let us first consider the following: 5 + (−5) = 0 10 + (−10) = 0 and 20 + (−20) = 0 If we subtract 5 from 5, we get 0, but then we still have to subtract 4: 5 − 9 = 5 − 5 − 4 = 0 − 4 = −4 Suppose the numbers are larger, for example 29 − 51: 29 − 51 = 29 − 29 − 22 We know that −9 = (−4) + (–5) −51 = (−29) + (−22) How much will be left of the 51, after you have subtracted 29 from 29 to get 0? How can we find out? Is it 51 − 29? Addition of a positive and a negative number Examples: 7 + (−5); 37 + (−45) and (−13) + 45 The following statement is true if the unknown number is 5: 20 − (a certain number) = 15 We also need numbers that will make sentences like the following true: 20 + (a certain number) = 15 But to go from 20 to 15 you have to subtract 5. The number we need to make the sentence 20 + (a certain number) = 15 true, must have the following strange property: If you add this number, it should have the same effect as subtracting 5. So, mathematicians agreed that the number called negative 5 will have the property that if you add it to another number, the effect will be the same as subtracting the natural number 5. This means that mathematicians agreed that 20 + (−5) is equal to 20 − 5. In other words, instead of adding negative 5 to a number, you may subtract 5. MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 1 20 (–5) + (–3) can also be written as –5 + (–3) or as –5 + –3 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 21 2017/04/13 2:28:21 PM Adding a negative number has the same effect as subtracting a corresponding natural number. For example: 20 + (−15) = 20 − 15 = 5. Subtraction of a negative number We have dealt with cases like −20 − (−7) on the previous page. The following statement is true if the number is 5: 25 + (a certain number) = 30 We also need a number to make this statement true: 25 − (a certain number) = 30 If you subtract this number, it should have the same effect as adding 5. It was agreed that: 25 − (−5) is equal to 25 + 5. Instead of subtracting the negative number, you add the corresponding positive number (the additive inverse): 8 − (−3) = 8 + 3 = 11 −5 − (−12) = −5 + 12 = 7 We may say that for each “positive” number there is a corresponding or opposite negative number. Two positive and negative numbers that correspond, for example 3 and (−3), are called additive inverses. Subtraction of a positive number from a negative number For example: −7 − 4 actually means (−7) − 4. Instead of subtracting a positive number, you add the corresponding negative number. For example: −7 − 4 can be seen as (−7) + (−4) = −11. calculations with integers Calculate each of the following: 1. −7 + 18 2. 24 − 30 − 7 3. −15 + (−14) − 9 4. 35 − (−20) 5. 30 − 47 6.

Calculate each of the following. Note that brackets are used for two purposes in these expressions, i.e. to indicate that certain operations are to be done first, and to show the integers. (a) 20 + (−5) (b) 4 × (20 + (−5)) (c) 4 × 20 + 4 × (−5) (d) (−5) + (−20) (e) 4 × ((−5) + (−20)) (f) 4 × (−5) + 4 × (−20) 2.

What property of integers is demonstrated in your answers for questions 3(a) and (g)? Explain your answer. In question 3(i) you had to multiply two negative numbers. What was your guess? We can calculate (−4) × (10 + (−5)) as in (h). It is (−4) × 5 = −20. If we want the distributive property to be true for integers, then (−4) × 10 + (−4) × (−5) must be equal to −20. (−4) × 10 + (−4) × (−5) = −40 + (−4) × (−5) MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 1 22 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 23 2017/04/13 2:28:21 PM Then (−4) × (−5) must be equal to 20. 5.

Do the three sets of calculations given in question 8. 10.Calculate (−10) × (5 + (−3)). 11. Now consider the question of whether or not multiplication by a negative number distributes over addition and subtraction of integers. For example, would (−10) × 5 + (−10) × (−3) also have the answer of −20, like (−10) × (5 + (−3))? To make sure that multiplication distributes over addition and subtraction in the system of integers, we have to agree that: (a negative number) × (a negative number) is a positive number. For example: (−10) × (−3) = 30. 23 CHAPTER 2: INTEGERS Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 24 2017/04/13 2:28:21 PM 12.

For example, (+12) + (−12) = 0. • Adding an integer has the same effect as subtracting its additive inverse. For example, 3 + (−10) can be calculated by doing 3 − 10, and the answer is −7. • Subtracting an integer has the same effect as adding its additive inverse. For example, 3 − (−10) can be calculated by calculating 3 + 10 is 13. • The product of a positive and a negative integer is negative.

Express each of the following numbers as twelfths: (a) 2 3 (b) 3 4 (c) 5 6 (d) 1 6 You may divide the numerator and denominator by the same number, instead of multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number. This gives you a simpler fraction. The simplest form of a fraction has no common factors. For example, you find the simplest form of the fraction 4 is 1 by dividing both the numerator 12 3 and denominator by the common factor of 4. 10. Convert each of the following fractions to their simplest form: (a) 40 100 (c) 5 25 (e) 6 24 (b) 4 16 (d) 6 30 (f) 8 88 converting between mixed numbers and fractions Numbers that have both whole number and fraction parts are called mixed numbers. 4 7 3 Examples of mixed numbers: 3 5 , 2 8 and 8 10 Mixed numbers can be written in expanded notation, for example: 4 4 7 7 3 3 3 5 means 3 + 5 2 8 means 2 + 8 8 10 means 8 + 10 . To add and subtract mixed numbers, you can work with the whole number parts and the fraction parts separately, for example: 4 3 3 4 3 5 + 13 5 13 5 − 3 5 (we need to “borrow” a unit from 13, 7 8 4 because we cannot subtract 4 3 = 16 5 = 12 5 − 3 5 5 from 5 ) = 17 2 5 = 9 4 5 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 30 2017/04/13 2:28:26 PM MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 1 30 5 5 8 + However, this method can be difficult to do with some examples, and it does not work with multiplication and division. An alternative and preferred method is to convert the mixed number to an improper fraction, as shown in the example below: 4 5 = 3 + 4 = 15 4 5 5 19 = 5 4 3 So, you can calculate 3 5 + 13 5 using this method: 4 3 3 5 + 13 5 = 19 5 = 87 5 + 68 5 The answer must be converted to a mixed number again: 87 = 17 2 5 5 1. Convert each of the following mixed numbers to improper fractions: (a) 5 3 (b) 2 3 (c) 3 4 7 (d) 4 5 12 2. Convert each of the following improper fractions to mixed numbers: (a) 32 5 (b) 25 8 (c) 24 9 (d) 37 20 3.2 Adding and subtracting fractions To add or subtract two fractions, they have to be expressed with the same denominators first. To achieve that, one or more of the given fractions may have to be replaced with equivalent fractions. 3 + 2 20 5 = 3 + 2 × 4 20 5 × 4 (to get twentieths) 5 + 7 12 20 = 5 × 20 + 7 × 12 12 × 20 20 × 12 We will later refer to this method of adding or subtracting fractions as Method A. = 3 20 = 11 20 + 8 20 = 100 240 = 184 240 = 23 30 + 84 240 note You can obtain the numerator of 19 in one step by multiplying the denominator (5) by the whole number (3), and then adding the numerator (4). 3 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 31 2017/04/13 2:28:27 PM 31 CHAPTER 3: FRACTIONS In the case of 5 + 7 , multiplying by 20 and by 12 was a sure way of making 12 20 equivalent fractions of the same kind, in this case two hundred-and-fortieths. However, the numbers became quite big. Just imagine how big the numbers will become if you use the same method to calculate 17 + 13 ! 75 85 Fortunately, there is a method of keeping the numbers smaller (in many cases) when making equivalent fractions, so that fractions can be added or subtracted. In this method you first calculate the lowest common multiple or LCM of the denominators. In the case of 5 + 7 , the smaller multiples of the denominators are: 12 20 12: 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 20: 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 The smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 20 is 60. Both 5 and 7 can be expressed in terms of sixtieths: 12 20 5 = 5 × 5 = 25 because to make twelfths into sixtieths you have to divide each 12 12 × 5 60 twelfth into five equal parts, to get 12 × 5 = 60 equal parts, i.e. sixtieths. Similarly, 7 = 7 × 3 = 21 . 20 20 × 3 60 Hence 5 + 7 = 25 + 21 = 46 = 23 12 20 60 60 60 30 We may call this method the LCM method of adding or subtracting fractions. adding and subtracting fractions 1.

Think about this: If you have 40 pizzas, how many learners can have 3 5 a pizza each? To find the number of fifths in 40 pizzas: 40 × 5 = 200 fifths of a pizza. To find the number of three fifths: 200 ÷ 3 = 66 portions of 3 pizza and two fifths of a pizza is left over. 5 Since the portion for each learner is three fifths, the two fifths of a pizza that remains is two thirds of a portion. So, to calculate 40 ÷ 3 , we multiplied by 5 and divided by 3, and that gave us 66 and 5 two thirds of a portion. In fact, we calculated 40 × 5 . 3 Division is the inverse of multiplication. So, to divide by a fraction, you multiply by its inverse. Example: 18 ÷ 2 60 3 = 18 60 × 3 = 54 2 120 = 9 20 multiplying and dividing fractions 1.

And so on! Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 41 2017/04/13 2:28:38 PM When you multiply decimal fractions, you change the decimals to whole numbers, do the calculation and lastly, change them back to decimal fractions. Example: To calculate 13,1 × 1,01, you first calculate 131 × 101 (which equals 13 231). Then, since you have multiplied the 13,1 by 10, and the 1,01 by 100 in order to turn them into whole numbers, you need to divide this answer by 10 × 100 (i.e. 1 000). Therefore, the final answer is 13,231. When you divide decimal fractions, you can use equivalent fractions to help you. Example: 21,7 ÷ 0,7 = 21,7 = 21,7 × 10 = 217 = 31 0,7 0,7 10 7 Notice how you multiply both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the same number (in this case, 10).

Mathematicians have decided to use negative exponents to indicate repetition of the multiplicative inverse of the base, for example 5 −4 is used to indicate 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 or ( 1 ) 4 , and x −3 is used to indicate ( 1 ) 3 , which is 1 × 1 × 1 . 5 5 5 5 5 x x x x This decision was not taken blindly – mathematicians were well aware that it makes good sense to use negative exponents in this meaning. One major advantage is that the negative exponents, when used in this meaning, have the same properties as positive exponents, for example: 2 −3 × 2 −4 = 2 (−3) + (−4) = 2 −7 because 2 −3 × 2 −4 means ( 1 × 1 × 1 ) × ( 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 ) which is ( 1 ) 7 . 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 −3 × 2 4 = 2 (−3) + 4 = 2 1 because 2 −3 × 2 4 means ( 1 × 1 × 1 ) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) which is 2. 2 2 2 x 2 3 4 5 2 × 5 2 2 × 5 x = 2 × 25 = 50 (2 × 5) 2 (2 × 5) x = 10 2 = 100 2 2 × 5 2 2 x × 5 x = 4 × 25 = 100 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 49 2017/04/13 2:28:41 PM negative exponents 1.

So, when you solve exponential equations, you are solving questions of the form; “To what power must the base be raised for the statement to be true?” To solve this kind of equation, remember that: If a m = a n , then m = n. In other words, if the base is the same on either side of the equation, then the exponents are the same. Example: 3 x = 243 3 x = 3 5 (rewrite using the same base) x = 5 (since the bases are the same, we equate the exponents) Some exponential equations are slightly more complex: Example: 3 x + 3 = 243 3 x + 3 = 3 5 (rewrite using the same base) x + 3 = 5 (equate the exponents) x = 2 Check: LHS 3 2 + 3 = 3 5 = 243 Remember that the exponent can also be negative. However, you follow the same method to solve these kinds of equations. Example: 2 x = 1 32 2 x = 2 −5 (rewrite using the same base) x = −5 (equate the exponents) solving exponential equations 1.

The diameter of a hydrogen atom, for example, is a very small number. It is 0,000000053 mm. The distance from the sun to the earth is, on average, 150 000 000 km. In scientific notation, the diameter of the hydrogen molecule is written as 5,3 × 10 −8 and the distance from the sun to the earth is written as 1,5 × 10 8 . It is easier to compare and to calculate numbers like these, as it is very cumbersome to count the zeros when you work with these numbers. Look at more examples below: Decimal notation Scientific notation 6 130 000 6,13 × 10 6 0,00001234 1,234 × 10 −5 A number written in scientific notation is written as the product of two numbers, in the form ± a × 10 n . Here, a is a decimal number between 1 and 10, and n is an integer. Any number can be written in scientific notation, for example: 40 = 4,0 × 10 2 = 2 × 10 0 The decimal number 324 000 000 is written as 3,24 × 10 8 in scientific notation, because the decimal comma is moved eight places to the left to form 3,24. The decimal number 0,00000065 written in scientific notation is 6,5 × 10 −7 , because the decimal point is moved seven places to the right to form the number 6,5.

(a) Write the next three numbers in each of the sequences below. (b) Describe the differences in the ways in which the three sequences are formed. 2. You will now make a sequence with the first term 5. Write 5 on the left on the line below. Then add 8 to the first term (5) to form the second term of your sequence. Write the second term next to the first term (5) in the line below. Now add 8 to the second term to form the third term. Continue like this to form ten more terms. A sequence can be formed by repeatedly adding or subtracting the same number. In this case the difference between consecutive terms in a sequence is constant. A sequence can be formed by repeatedly multiplying or dividing. In this case the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. A sequence can also be formed in such a way that neither the difference nor the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. 3. Write the next three terms of each sequence. In each case also describe what the pattern is, for example “there is a constant difference of −5 between consecutive terms”.

The first (or another) term must be given. This kind of formula has two parts: the first term and the relationship between terms. • A description of the relationship between the value of the term and its position in the sequence: This relationship describes the calculations that can be done on the term number to produce the term value, as in question 5(b), (d) and (e) on the previous page. make two formulae for the same sequence 1. Choose any whole number smaller than 10 as the first term of a sequence. (a) Copy the table. Use your chosen first term to form a sequence by adding 5 repeatedly.

In each question, there were two variable quantities. If one variable quantity is influenced by another, we say there is a relationship between the two variables. You can sometimes work out which number is linked to a specific value of the other variable. An algebraic expression, such as 10x + 5, describes what calculations must be done to find the output number that corresponds to a given input number. For any input number, application of the rule 10x + 5 produces only one output number, and it is very clear what that number is. For instance, if the formula is applied to x = 3, the output number is 35. A relationship between two variables in which there is only one output number for each input number, is called a function. Functions can be represented in: • a table that shows some values of the two variables as it clearly shows which value of the output variable corresponds to each particular value of the input variable • a flow diagram, which shows what calculations are to be done to calculate the output number that corresponds to a given input variable The output number can also be called the output value, or the value of the expression, which is 10x + 5 in this case. A quantity that changes is called a variable quantity or just a variable. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 64 2017/04/13 2:28:43 PM • a formula, which also describes what calculations are to be done to calculate the output number that corresponds to a given input variable • a graph. Examples of these four ways of describing a function are given on the next two pages. 1. Copy and complete the following flow diagram: –1 –2 –3 –4 –5 A completed flow diagram shows two kinds of information: • It shows what calculations are done to produce the output numbers. • It shows which output number is connected to which input number. The flow diagram that you completed shows: • that each input number is multiplied by 5, then 20 is added, to produce the output numbers • which output numbers correspond to which input numbers. The calculations that need to be done can also be described with an expression. The expression 5x + 20 describes the calculations that you did in question 1. You can also write this as a formula: • A verbal formula: output number = 5 × input number + 20 • An algebraic formula: output number = 5x + 20 2. Copy and complete this table for the function described by 5x + 20: Input numbers −1 −2 −3 −4 −5 Function values 3. Draw a graph of this function discussed in question 1 and 2 on graph paper.

Copy and complete the following table: (a) (b) (c) An algebraic expression indicates a sequence of operations that can also be described in words. In some cases they can be described with flow diagrams. Expressions in brackets should always be calculated first. If there are no brackets in an algebraic expression, it means that multiplication and division must be done first, and addition and subtraction afterwards. For example, if x = 5 the expression 12 + 3x means “multiply 5 by 3, then add 12”. It does not mean “add 12 and 3, then multiply by 5”. If you wish to say “add 12 and 3, then multiply by 5”, the numerical expression should be 5 × (12 + 3) or (12 + 3) × 5. 2. Describe each of these sequences of calculations with an algebraic expression: (a) Multiply a number by 10, subtract 5 from the answer, and multiply the answer by 3.

The symbol x is often used to represent the variable in an algebraic expression, but other letter symbols may also be used. In the monomial 3x 2 , the 3 is called the coefficient of x 2 . In the binomial 5x + 4, and the trinomial 3x 2 + 2x + 9, the numbers 4 and 9 are called constants. 1.

Although they may look different, make a list of all the algebraic expressions above which have the same numerical value for the same value of x. Equivalent expressions are algebraic expressions that have different sequences of operations, but have the same numerical value for any given value of x. It is often convenient not to work with a given expression, but to replace it with an equivalent expression. 3. Copy and complete the following table: x 2 3 5 10 −5 −10 12x − 7 + 3x + 10 − 5x 4.

What do you think is the easiest way to find out? conventions for writing algebraic expressions Here are some things that mathematicians have agreed upon, and it makes mathematical work much easier if all people stick to these agreements. The multiplication sign is often omitted in algebraic expressions: We normally write 4x instead of 4 × x, and 4(x − 5) instead of 4 × (x − 5). It is a convention to write a known number first in a product, i.e. we write 3 × x rather than x × 3, and we write 3x but not x3. 1. Rewrite each of the following in the normal way of writing algebraic expressions: (a) x × 4 + x × y − y × 3 (b) 7 × (10 − x) + (5 × x + 3)10 People all over the world have agreed that, in expressions that do not contain brackets, addition and subtraction should be performed as they appear from left to right. According to this convention, x − y + z means that you first have to subtract y from x, then add z. For example if x = 10, y = 5 and z = 3, x − y + z is 10 − 5 + 3 and it means 10 − 5 = 5, then 5 + 3 = 8. It does not mean 5 + 3 = 8, then 10 − 8 = 2. 2. Calculate 50 − 20 + 30 and 50 + 30 − 20 and 50 − 30 + 20. 3. Evaluate each of the following expressions for x = 10, y = 5 and z = 2: (a) x + y − z (b) x − z + y (c) 10y − 3x + 5z − 4y (d) 10y − 3x − 5z + 4y + 3x People have also agreed that, in expressions that do not contain brackets, we should do multiplication (and division) before addition and subtraction. Hence, 5 + 3 × 4 should be understood as “multiply 4 by 3, then add the answer to 5”; not as “add 5 and 3 then multiply the answer by 4”. Also, 3 × 4 + 5 should be understood as “multiply 4 by 3, then add 5 to the answer”; not as “add 4 and 5 then multiply the answer by 3”. MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 1 70 A convention is something that people have agreed to do in the same way. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 71 2017/04/13 2:28:44 PM 4. Do each of the following calculations: (a) Multiply 4 by 3, then add 5 to the answer. (b) Add 4 and 5, then multiply the answer by 3. (c) Multiply 4 by 3, then add the answer to 5. (d) Add 5 and 3, then multiply the answer by 4. 5. Rewrite the instructions in 4(a) and 4(c) without using words. 6. Calculate each of the following: (a) 10 × 5 + 30 (b) 30 + 10 × 5 (c) 10 × 5 − 30 (d) 30 − 10 × 5 7. (a) Add 4 and 5, then subtract the answer from 20. (b) Subtract 4 from 20 and then add 5. (c) Add 4 and 5, then multiply the answer by 3. (d) Multiply 3 by 5 and then add the answer to 4. If we want to specify the calculations in 7(a) and 7(c) without using words, we will face challenges. We cannot write 20 − 4 + 5 for “add 4 and 5 then subtract the answer from 20”, because that would mean “subtract 4 from 20, then add 5”. We need a way to indicate, without using words, that we want the addition to be performed before the subtraction in this case. Similarly, we cannot write 4 + 5 × 3 for “add 4 and 5 then multiply the answer by 3”, because that would mean “multiply 3 by 5 and then add the answer to 4”. We need a way to indicate, without using words, that we want the addition to be performed before the multiplication in this case. Mathematicians have agreed to use brackets to address the above challenges. The following convention is used all over the world: Whenever there are brackets in an expression, the calculations within the brackets should be performed first. Hence, 20 − (4 + 5) means “add 4 and 5 then subtract the answer from 20”, but 20 − 4 + 5 means “subtract 4 from 20, then add 5”. (4 + 5) × 3 or 3 × (4 + 5) means “add 4 and 5 then multiply the answer by 3”, but 4 + 5 × 3 means “multiply 3 by 5, then add the answer to 4”. 10 + 2(5 + 9) means “add 5 and 9, multiply the answer by 2, then add this answer to 10”: 5 + 9 = 14 14 × 2 = 28 28 + 10 = 38 71 CHAPTER 8: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 72 2017/04/13 2:28:44 PM 8. Calculate each of the following: (a) 100 + 50 − 30 (b) 100 + (50 − 30) (c) 100 − 50 + 30 (d) 100 − (50 + 30) (e) 3(10 − 4) + 2 (f) 10(5 + 7) + 3(18 − 8) (g) 250 − 10 × (18 + 2) + 35 (h) (20 + 20) × (20 − 10) (i) (250 − 10) × (18 + 2) + 35 (j) 20 + 20 × (20 − 10) (k) 200 + (100 × 2(15 + 5)) (l) (200 + 100) × 2 × 15 + 5 In algebra, we normally write 3(x + 2y) instead of (x + 2y) × 3, and we write 3(x − 2y) instead of (x − 2y) × 3. Do not let this conventional way of writing in algebra confuse you. The expression 3(x + 2y) does not mean that multiplication by 3 is the first thing you should do when you evaluate the expression for certain values of x and y. The first thing you should do is to add the values of x and y. That is what the brackets tell you! However, performing the instructions 3(x + 2y) is not the only way in which you can find out how much 3(x + 2y) is for any given values of x and y. Instead of working out 3(x + 2y), you may work out 3x + 6y. In this case you will multiply each term before you add them together. 9. Evaluate each of the following expressions for x = 10, y = 5 and z = 2: (a) xy + z (b) x(y + z) (c) x + yz (d) xy + xz (e) xy − z (f) x(y − z) (g) x − yz (h) xy − yz (i) x + (y − z) (j) x − (y − z) (k) x − (y + z) (l) x − y − z (m) x + y − z (n) x − y + z 8.2 Properties of operations 1. Calculate each of the following: (a) 5(3 + 4) (b) 5 × 3 + 5 × 4 (c) 6 × 3 + (4 + 6) (d) (6 + 4) + 3 × 6 (e) 3 × (4 × 5) (f) (3 × 4) × 5 You should have noticed that for each row the results are the same. This is because operations with numbers have certain properties, namely the distributive, commutative and associative properties. MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 1 72 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 73 2017/04/13 2:28:44 PM When you form an expression that is equivalent to a given expression, you say that you manipulate the expression. The distributive property is used each time you multiply a number in parts. For example: The number thirty-four is actually 30 + 4. You may calculate 5 × 34 by calculating 5 × 30 and 5 × 4, and then adding the two answers: 5 × 34 = 5 × 30 + 5 × 4 2. Calculate each of the following: (a) 5(x − y) for x = 10 and y = 8 (b) 5x − 5y for x = 10 and y = 8 (c) 5(x − y) for x = 100 and y = 30 (d) 5x − 5y for x = 100 and y = 30 (e) 5(x − y + z) for x = 10, y = 3 and z = 2 (f) 5x − 5y + 5z for x = 10, y = 3 and z = 2 3. We say “multiplication distributes over addition”. Does multiplication also distribute over subtraction? Give examples to support your answer. For any values of x and y: • x + y and y + x give the same answers, and • xy and yx give the same answers. This is called the commutative property of addition and multiplication. 4. We say “addition is commutative” and “multiplication is commutative”. Is subtraction also commutative? Demonstrate your answer with an example. The associative property allows you to arrange three or more numbers in any sequence when adding or multiplying. For any values of x, y and z, the following expressions all have the same answer: x + y + z y + x + z z + y + x 5. Calculate 16 + 33 + 14 + 17 in the easiest possible way. The associative property of multiplication allows you to simplify something like the following: abc + bca + cba Because the order of multiplication does not change the result we can rewrite this expression as: abc + abc + abc. This then can be simplified by adding like terms to be 3abc. You will be able to use these properties throughout this chapter and when you do algebraic manipulations. 73 CHAPTER 8: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS The word “distribute” means to spread out. The distributive property may be described as follows: a(b + c) = ab + ac where a, b and c can be any numbers. We may say: “multiplication distributes over addition”. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 74 2017/04/13 2:28:44 PM 6. Replace each of the following expressions with a simpler expression that will give the same answer. Do not do any calculations now. In each case, state why your replacement will be easier to do. (a) 17 × 43 + 17 × 57 (b) 7 × 5 × 8 × 4 + 12 × 8 × 4 × 7 − 9 × 4 × 5 × 8 (c) 43 × 17 + 57 × 17 (d) 43x + 57x (for x = 213 or any other value) 7. Which properties of operations did you use in each part of question 6? 8.3 Combining like terms in algebraic expressions rearrange terms, then combine like terms To check whether two expressions are possibly equivalent, you can evaluate both expressions for several different values of the variable. 1. In each case below, copy the tables, then predict whether the two expressions are equivalent. Check by evaluating both for x = 1, x = 10, x = 2 and x = −2 in the tables. (a) x(x + 3) and x 2 + 3 (b) x(x + 3) and x 2 + 3x Some expressions can be simplified by rearranging the terms and combining “like terms”. In the expression 5x 2 + 13x + 7 + 2x 2 − 8x − 12, the terms 5x 2 and 2x 2 are like terms. Two or more like terms can be combined to form a single term. 5x 2 + 2x 2 can be replaced by 7x 2 because for any value of x, for example x = 2 or x = 10, calculating 5x 2 + 2x 2 and 7x 2 will produce the same output value.

Copy and complete the following table: x 10 2 5 1 5x 2 + 2x 2 7x 2 13x − 8x 5x It is difficult to see the like terms in a long expression like 3x 2 + 13x + 7 + 2x 2 − 8x − 12.

Simplify: (a) (2r 2 + 3r − 5) + (7r 2 − 8r − 12) (b) (2r 2 + 3r − 5) − (7r 2 − 8r − 12) (c) (2x + 5xy + 3y) − (12x − 2xy − 5y) (d) (2x + 5xy + 3y) + (12x − 2xy − 5y) 7.

Write equivalent expressions without brackets: (a) 3x 4 − (x 2 + 2x) (b) 3x 4 − (x 2 − 2x) (c) 3x 4 + (x 2 − 2x) (d) x − (y + z − t) 9. Write equivalent expressions without brackets, rearrange so that like terms are grouped together, and then combine the like terms: (a) 2y 2 + (y 2 − 3y) (b) 3x 2 + (5x + x 2 ) (c) 6x 2 − (x 4 + 3x 2 ) (d) 2t 2 − (3t 2 − 5t 3 ) (e) 6x 2 + 3x − (4x 2 + 5x) (f) 2r 2 − 5r + 7 + (3r 2 − 7r − 8) (g) 5(x 2 + x) + 2(x 2 + 3x) (h) 2x(x − 3) + 5x(x + 2) 10. Write equivalent expressions without brackets and simplify these expressions as far as possible.

(a) Calculate 3 × 38 and 3 × 62, and add the two answers. (b) Add 38 and 62, then multiply the answer by 3. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 77 2017/04/13 2:28:45 PM (c) If you do not get the same answer for (a) and (b), you have made a mistake. Rework until you get it right. The fact that if you work correctly, you get the same answer in questions 1(a) and (b), is a demonstration of the distributive property. What you saw in question 1 was that: 3 × 100 = 3 × 38 + 3 × 62. This can also be expressed by writing 3(38 + 62) = 3 × 38 + 3 × 62. 2. (a) Calculate 10 × 56. (b) Calculate 10 × 16 + 10 × 40. 3. (a) Write down any two numbers smaller than 100. Let us call them x and y. Add your two numbers and multiply the answer by 3. (b) Calculate 3 × x and 3 × y, and add the two answers. (c) If you do not get the same answers for (a) and (b), you have made a mistake somewhere. Correct your work. 4. Copy and complete the following table: x 12 50 5 y 4 30 10 5x − 5y 5(x − y) 5x + 5y 5(x + y) Performing the instructions 5(x + y) is not the only way in which you can find out how much 5(x + y) is for any given values of x and y. Instead of doing 5(x + y), you may do 5x + 5y. In this case you will multiply first, and again, before you add. 77 CHAPTER 8: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS The distributive property may be described as follows: a(b + c) = ab + ac and a(b − c) = ab − ac, where a, b and c can be any numbers. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 78 2017/04/13 2:28:45 PM 5. (a) For x = 10 and y = 20, evaluate 8(x + y) by first adding 10 and 20, and then multiplying by 8. (b) Now evaluate 8(x + y) by doing 8x + 8y; in other words, first calculate 8 × 10 and 8 × 20. 6. In question 5 you evaluated 8(x + y) in two different ways for the given values of x and y. Now also evaluate 20(x − y) in two different ways, for x = 5 and y = 3. 7. Use the distributive property in each of the following cases to make a different expression that is equivalent to the given expression: (a) a(b + c) (b) a(b + c + d) (c) x(x + 1) (d) x(x 2 + x + 1) (e) x(x 3 + x 2 + x + 1) (f) x 2 (x 2 − x + 3) (g) 2x 2 (3x 2 + 2) (h) 3x 3 (2x 2 + 4x − 5) (i) −2x 4 (x 3 − 2x 2 − 4x + 5) (j) a 2 b(a 3 − a 2 + a + 1) (k) x 2 y 3 (3x 2 y + xy 2 − y) (l) −2x(x 3 − y 3 ) (m) 2a 2 b(3a 2 + 2a 2 b 2 + 4b 2 ) (n) 2ab 2 (3a 3 − 1) 8.

Write in expanded form: (a) x(x 2 + 2xy + y 2 ) + y(x 2 + 2xy + y 2 ) (b) x 2 y(x 2 − 2xy + y 2 ) − xy 2 (2x 2 − 3xy − y 2 ) (c) ab 2 c(b 2 c 2 − ac) + b 2 c 4 (a 2 + abc 2 ) (d) p 2 q(pq 2 + p + q) + pq(p − q 2 ) squares and cubes and roots of monomials 1. Evaluate each of the following expressions for x = 2, x = 5 and x = 10: (a) (3x) 2 (b) 9x 2 (c) (2x) 2 (d) 4x 2 (e) (2x) 3 (f) 8x 3 (g) (2x + 3x) 2 (h) (10x − 7x) 2 2. In each case, write an equivalent monomial without brackets: (a) (5x) 2 (b) (5x) 3 (c) (20x) 2 (d) (10x) 3 (e) (2x + 7x) 2 (f) (20x − 13x) 3 The square root of 16x 2 is 4x, because (4x) 2 = 16x 2 .

The division symbol is to the right of the brackets; it is not left-distributive, for example: 10 ÷ (2 + 4) ≠ (10 ÷ 2) + (10 ÷ 4). For example: (200 + 40) ÷ 20 = (200 ÷ 20) + (40 ÷ 20) = 10 + 2 = 12, and (500 + 200 − 300) ÷ 50 = (500 ÷ 50) + (200 ÷ 50) − (300 ÷ 50) 4. Evaluate each expression for x = 2 and x = 10: (a) (10x 2 + 5x) ÷ 5 (b) (10x 2 ÷ 5) + (5x ÷ 5) (c) 2x 2 + x (d) (10x 2 + 5x) ÷ 5x (e) (10x 2 ÷ 5x) + (5x ÷ 5x) (f) 2x + 1 The distributive property of division can be expressed in the following way: (x + y) ÷ z = (x ÷ z) + (y ÷ z) (x − y) ÷ z = (x ÷ z) − (y ÷ z) 5. (a) Do not do any calculations. Which of the following expressions do you think will have the same value as (10x 2 + 20x − 15) ÷ 5, for x = 10 as well as x = 2? 2x 2 + 20x − 15 10x 2 + 20x − 3 2x 2 + 4x − 3 (b) Do the necessary calculations to check your answer. 6.

Hence, instead of (10x 2 + 20x − 15) ÷ 5, we may write 10x 2 + 20x  15 . 5 Since (10x 2 + 20x − 15) ÷ 5 is equivalent to (10x 2 ÷ 5) + (20x ÷ 5) − (15 ÷ 5), 10x 2 + 20x  15 is equivalent to 10x 2 + 20x − 15 . 5 5 5 5 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 81 2017/04/13 2:28:49 PM 81 CHAPTER 8: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 8.

In order to expand (x + 2)(x + 3), you can first keep (x + 2) as it is, and apply the distributive property: (x + 2)(x + 3) = (x + 2)x + (x + 2)3 = x 2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = x 2 + 5x + 6 1. Describe how can you check if (x + 2)(x + 3) is actually equivalent to x 2 + 5x + 6. To expand (x − y)(x + 3y) it can be written as (x − y)x + (x − y)3y, and the two parts can then be expanded. (x − y)(x + 3y) = (x − y)x + (x − y)3y = x 2 − xy + 3xy − 3y 2 = x 2 + 2xy − 3y 2 2. Do some calculations to check whether (x − y)(x + 3y) and x 2 + 2xy − 3y 2 are equivalent.

Consider this situation: To rent a room in a certain building, you have to pay a deposit of R400 and then R80 per day. (a) How much money do you need to rent the room for ten days? (b) How much money do you need to rent the room for 15 days? 2. Which of the following best describes the method that you used to do question 1(a) and (b)? A. Total cost = R400 + R80 B. Total cost = 400(number of days + 80) C. Total cost = 80 × number of days + 400 D. Total cost = (80 + 400) × number of days 3. For how many days can you rent the room described in question 1, if you have R2 800 to pay? If you want to know for how many days you can rent the room if you have R720, you can set up an equation and solve it. Example: You know the total cost is R720 and you know that you can work out the total cost like this: Total cost = 80x + 400, where x is the number of days. So, 80x + 400 = 720 and x = four days.

Sarah paid a deposit of R320 for a stall at a market, and she also pays R70 per day rental for the stall. She sells fruit and vegetables at the stall, and finds that she makes about R150 profit each day. After how many days will she have earned as much as she has paid for the stall, in total? 9.5 Solving equations by using the laws of exponents You may need to look back at Chapter 5 to remember the laws of exponents. One kind of exponential equation that you deal with in Grade 9 has one or more terms with a base that is raised to a power containing a variable. Example: 2 x = 16 When we need to find the unknown value, we are asking the question: “To what power must the base be raised for the statement to be true?” Example: 2 x = 16 Make sure that the terms with x are on their own on one side. 2 x = 2 4 Write the known term in the same base as the term with the exponent. x = 4 Equate the exponents. In the example above, we can equate the exponents because the two numbers are equal only when they are raised to the same power.

The order in which you write the letters when stating that two triangles are congruent is very important. The letters of the corresponding vertices between the two triangles must appear in the same position in the notation. For example, the notation for the triangles on the previous page should be: ∆ABC ≡ ∆XYZ, because it indicates that A  = X  , B  = Y  , C  = Z  , AB = XY, BC = YZ and AC = XZ. It is incorrect to write ∆ABC ≡ ∆ZYX. Although the letters refer to the same triangles, this notation indicates that A  = Z  , C  = X  , AB = ZY and BC = YX, and these statements are not true. Write down the equal angles and sides according to the following notations: 1. ∆KLM ≡ ∆PQR 2. ∆FGH ≡ ∆CST minimum conditions for congruent triangles Earlier in this chapter, you investigated the minimum conditions that must be satisfied in order to establish that two triangles are congruent. The conditions for congruency consist of: • SSS (all corresponding sides are equal) • SAS (two corresponding sides and the angle between the two sides are equal) • AAS (two corresponding angles and any corresponding side are equal) • RHS (both triangles have a 90° angle and have equal hypotenuses and one other side equal).

The following notation shows that the triangles are similar: ∆BAC ///∆DEF. Why do you think we write the first triangle as ∆BAC and not as ∆ABC? The properties of similar triangles: • The corresponding angles are equal. • The corresponding sides are in proportion. Notation for similar triangles: If ∆XYZ is similar to ∆PQR, then we write: ∆XYZ ///∆PQR. As for the notation of congruent figures, the order of the letters in the notation of similar triangles indicates which angles and sides are equal. For ∆XYZ ///∆PQR: Angles: X  = P  , Y  = Q  and Z  = R   Sides: XY: PQ = XZ: PR = YZ: QR If the triangles’ vertices were written in a different order, then the statements above would not be true.

For example, in a 6-8-9 triangle: 6 2 + 8 2 = 100 and 9 2 = 81. 81 is less than 100 ∴ the 6-8-9 triangle is acute. • If the square of the longest side is more than the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides, the biggest angle is obtuse. For example, in a 6-8-11 triangle: 6 2 + 8 2 = 100 and 11 2 = 121. 121 is more than 100 ∴ the 6-8-11 triangle is obtuse. c a Copy and complete the following table.

You will remember the following about circles from previous grades: • The distance across the circle through its centre is called the diameter (d) of the circle. • The distance from the centre of the circle to any point on the circumference is called the radius (r). • The circumference (c) of a circle divided by its diameter is equal to the irrational value we call pi (π). To simplify calculations, we often use the approximate values: π ≈ 3,14 or 22 . 7 The following are important formulae to remember: • d = 2r and r = 1 d 2 • Circumference of a circle (c) = 2πr • Area of a circle (A) = πr 2 circle calculations In the following calculations, use π = 3,14 and round off your answers to two decimal places.

This is the inverse of expansion. factorisation x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3). expansion Each part of a product is called a factor of the expression. If c = ab, then a and b are factors of c. x + 2 and x + 3 are the factors of (x + 2)(x + 3). Since x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3), x + 2 and x + 3 are the factors of x 2 + 5x + 6. 1. Calculate the value of each of the following expressions for x = 12: (a) (x + 2)(x + 5) x + 2 (c) x(2x + 1) 2x + 1 2. Check if the following statements are identities by expanding the expressions on the right. (b) (x  3)(x  4) x 4 (d) (x + 5)(x  5) x 5 (a) x 2 − 9 = (x + 3)(x − 3) (b) x 2 + x − 6 = (x + 3)(x − 2) (c) x 2 + 4x + 3 = (x + 3)(x + 1) (d) x 2 + 3x = x(x + 3) 3. Write down the factors of each of the following expressions: (a) x 2 + x − 6 (b) x 2 + 3x (c) x 2 + 4x + 3 (d) x 2 − 9 4. Simplify the following quotients (algebraic fractions): (a) x 2  9 x  3 (b) x 2  x  6 x  3 (c) x 2  x  6 x 2 (d) x 2  4x  3 ( x  3)( x  1) Chapter 16 Algebraic expressions A statement like 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6, which is true for all values of x you can think of, is called an identity. A numerical or algebraic expression that requires multiplication as a last step, is called a product. For example, 12(37 + 63), 2x(x – 5) and xyz are called products. A product is a monomial. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 166 2017/04/13 2:29:09 PM note that: b − a = –a + b = – (a – b) 5. (a) Suppose you have to find the value of the expression for x = 15. Which expression will be the least amount of work: x 2  9 or x − 3? x  3 (b) Are you sure that you will get the same answers for the two expressions? In the following sections you will learn how to factorise certain types of expressions. The following identities are useful for the purposes of factorisation: a(b + c) = ab + ac (x + a)(x + b) = x 2 + (a + b)x + ab (a + b)(a − b) = a 2 − b 2 16.2 Factors of expressions of the form ab + ac the greatest common factor 1.

(d) Find another factor of ab + ac. (e) Now try and simplify: ab  ac . a Suppose you have to factorise 4x 3 + 2x 2 − 6x: It is clear that 2x is a factor of every term, hence it is a factor of 4x 3 + 2x 2 − 6x. By division we get 4x 3  2x 2  6x 2x = 2x 2 + x − 3. Hence 4x 3 + 2x 2 − 6x = 2x(2x 2 + x − 3). It is always a good idea to check factorisation by expanding the answer and making sure that the result is equal to the original expression. 3.

By copying and completing the tables below you will learn something that will help you to find the factors of expressions of the form x 2 + (b + c) x + bc, for example: x 2 + 17x + 30. b 1 2 3 5 −1 −2 −3 −5 c 30 15 10 6 −30 −15 −10 −6 b + c bc b −1 −2 −3 −5 1 2 3 5 c 30 15 10 6 −30 −15 −10 −6 b + c bc 2. For each case below, find two numbers x and y so that their product xy is 30 and their sum x + y is the given number: (a) xy = 30 and x + y = 13 (b) xy = 30 and x + y = −17 (c) xy = 30 and x + y = −11 (d) xy = 30 and x + y = 11 3.

Find x and y in each case: (a) xy = 36 and x + y = 15 (b) xy = 40 and x + y = 22 (c) xy = 36 and x + y = 20 (d) xy = −40 and x + y = 18 (e) xy = 36 and x + y = −20 (f) xy = −40 and x + y = −18 5. Evaluate each expression for x = 2. Also expand each expression. (a) (x + 5)(x − 2) (b) (x + 5)(x + 2) (c) (x − 5)(x − 2) (d) (x − 5)(x + 2) 6. Evaluate each polynomial you formed in question 5 for x = 2. Compare the answers with the values of the corresponding product expressions in question 1. In cases where the values differ, you have made a mistake somewhere. Sort out any mistakes before you continue with question 7. CHAPTER 16: ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 167 You may use the tables you completed in question 1 to find the answers to some of these questions. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 168 2017/04/13 2:29:09 PM 7. Expand each product: (a) (x + 3)(x + 8) (b) (x + 2)(x + 12) (c) (x + 4)(x + 6) (d) (x + 1)(x + 24) (e) (x + 3)(x − 8) (f) (x + 2)(x − 12) (g) (x + 4)(x − 6) (h) (x + 1)(x − 24) 16.3 Factors of expressions of the form x 2 + (b + c)x + bc The expanded form of a product of two linear binomials, such as (x + 3)(x + 8), or (x + 3)(x − 8), is a quadratic trinomial, such as x 2 + 11x + 24 or x 2 − 5x − 24 with: • a term in x 2 • a term in x that is called the middle term, which is +11x in x 2 + 11x + 24 and −5x in x 2 − 5x − 24 • a constant term also called the last term, which is +24 in x 2 + 11x + 24, and −24 in x 2 − 5x − 24. To factorise an expression, such as x 2 + 5x + 6, means to reverse the process of expansion. This means that we have to find out which binomials will produce the trinomial when the product of the binomials is expanded, for example: x 2 + 5x + 6 = (? + ?)(? + ?) (x + 2)(x + 3) expansion factorisation = x 2 + 5x + 6 try to find the factors 1. Write the following out and fill in the missing parts of the factors in each case: (a) (x + 3)(x ) = x 2 + 9x + 18 (b) (x + 2)(x ) = x 2 + 11x + 18 (c) (x + 3)(x − ) = x 2 + 9x − 18 (d) ( + )(x + 2) = x 2 + 5x + 6 (e) x 2 − x − 6 168 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 3 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 169 2017/04/13 2:29:09 PM 2. Expand each product: (a) (x + p)(x + q) (b) (x + p)(x − q) (c) (x − p)(x + q) (d) (x − p)(x − q) The product of the first terms of the factors must be equal to the x 2 term of the trinomial. Meaning: x × x = x 2 x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) Meaning: 2 × 3 = 6 The product of the last terms of the factors must be equal to the last term (the constant term) of the trinomial. The sum of the inner and outer products must be equal to the term in x (the middle term) of the trinomial. x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) Meaning: 2x + 3x = (2 + 3)x = 5x (x + a)(x + b) = x × x + ax + bx + a × b = x 2 + (a + b)x + ab 3. Try to factorise the following trinomials: (a) x 2 + 8x + 12 (b) x 2 − 8x + 12 practice makes perfect 1. Factorise the following trinomials.

Can you explain why factors of a 2 − b 2 have this form? Stated differently: If p and q are perfect squares, also “algebraic squares”, then: p − q = ( 9x 4 − 4y 2 = ( q )( p − q ) + 4y 2 )( 9x 4 − 4y 2 ) = (3x 2 + 2y)(3x 2 − 2y) (Note the operations within the brackets differ.) factorising difference between two squares expressions 1.

Did you get the “solution” with which you started? When you solve an equation, you actually reverse the making of the equation. 5. Solve for x: (a) 2(x + 4) + 9 = 15 (b) 5(x − 2) = 7(2 − x) (c) 2x − 2 = 12 (d) 3y  3 + 5 = 5y 3 2 2 3 Up to now you have only dealt with equations of the first degree. That means they contained only first powers of the unknown (x), for example 3x − 2 = 5x + 7. In the following sections you will solve equations of the second degree, where the expressions contain second powers. This is an equation of the second degree: x 2 + 1 = x + 13. When the expression part of the equation is written as the product of a monomial and a binomial (e.g. x(x − 2) = 0); or the product of two binomials (e.g. (x − 2)(x + 3) = 0), the result is also an equation of the second degree. 17.2 Solving by factorisation (Part 1) developing a strategy: multiplying by zero 1. Can you find two numbers x and y so that if you multiply them the answer is 0, i.e. xy = 0? 178 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 3 Each part of a product is called a factor of the expression. If c = ab, then a and b are factors of c. If x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3), then x + 2 and x + 3 are factors of x 2 + 5x + 6. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 179 2017/04/13 2:29:15 PM 2. Copy and complete the following table: Equation Factors Product First possible solution Second possible solution Example x(x − 2) = 0 x and (x − 2) 0 x = 0 x − 2 = 0 x = 2 (a) x(x + 5) = 0 (b) 2x(3x − 12) = 0 (c) 0 = (x + 2)(x − 2) You can rewrite an equation so that it is in the form expression = 0; for example you can write x 2 − 2x = 3x + 6 as x 2 − 5x − 6 = 0. You can factorise x 2 − 5x − 6 and then use the zero-product property to solve the equation, as shown below: x 2 − 5x − 6 = 0 (x − 6)(x + 1) = 0 x = 6 or x = −1 In a later section you will solve equations like the above example. You have to write the equation in the form, expression = 0, then factorise the left-hand side and then use the zero-product property. taking out the highest common factor The process of writing a sum expression (polynomial) as a product (monomial) is called factorisation. This is the inverse of expansion. Look at the expression 2x 2 − 6x. 2x is a factor of both terms, therefore it is a factor of 2x 2 − 6x. By division we get 2x 2  6x 2x = x − 3. Hence 2x 2 − 6x = 2x(x − 3). 179 CHAPTER 17: EQUATIONS It is unnecessary to write out the division step of this method. After finding the common factor, we write down the product form directly: 2x 2 – 6x = 2x(x – 3) zero-product property If: a × b = 0 Then: a = 0 or b = 0 or a = 0 and b = 0 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 180 2017/04/13 2:29:16 PM 180 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 3 Determine the values of x which will make the following statements true: 1. x 2 = −3x 2. x 2 + 2x 2 = 6x 3. 6x + x = −4x 2 4. x = x(2 − x) 3 17.3 Solving by factorisation (Part 2) solving by factorising trinomials The product of the first terms of the factors must be equal to the x 2 term of the trinomial. The product of the last terms of the factors must be equal to the last term (the constant term) of the trinomial. x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) Meaning: x.x = x 2 Meaning: 2.3 = 6 The sum of the inner and outer products must be equal to the x term of the trinomial. x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) Meaning: (2 + 3)x = 5x The factors are of the form: (x.x) + (a + b)x + (a.b) = (x + a)(x + b). Determine the values of x which will make the following statements true. Remember to write the equation in the form expression = 0 so that you can use the zero- product property. 1. x 2 + 9x = −14 2. x 2 + 3x = 18 3. x 2 − 18x = −17 4. x 2 + 30 = 11x 5. x 2 = 13x + 30 6. x 2 + 7x = 30 solving by factorising the difference between two squares Remember from the previous chapter: If p and q are perfect squares, also “algebraic squares”, then: p − q = ( p + q)( p − q) 9x 4 − 4y 2 = ( 9x 4 + 4y 2 )( 9x 4 − 4y 2 ) = (3x 2 + 2y)(3x 2 − 2y) Determine the values of the unknown (x or a or n, etc.) which will make the statements on the next page true. An expression of the form a 2 – b 2 is called the difference between two squares. To factorise a difference between squares, we use the identity: a 2 – b 2 = (a + b)(a − b) where a and b represent numbers or algebraic expressions.

Printing shop B charges 35c per page and R15 for binding a book. For a book with the same amount of pages, will the two shops charge the same? You can write an equation to describe the problem. Let the number of pages for which the work costs the same be x. Then: 45x + 1 200 = 35x + 1 500. Now solve the equation. 45x + 1 200 = 35x + 1 500 45x − 35x = 1 500 − 1 200 10x = 300 x = 30 We may now ask what the solution to the mathematical problem (“x = 30”) means in terms of the practical situation. When the equation was set up above, the symbol x was used as a placeholder for the number of pages in a book for which the two shops would charge the same. So, what does the solution tell you? Now check to see if the two shops will charge the same for a book with 30 pages. At shop A, 30 pages will cost 30 × 45c = 1 350c = R13,50. Binding is R12; total cost is R25,50. At shop B, 30 pages will cost 30 × 35c = 1 050c = R10,50. Binding is R15; total cost is R25,50. The solution to the mathematical problem is also a solution to the practical problem. 182 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 3 The mathematical solution should be tested in the practical situation, because mistakes may have been made. The mathematical solution may be interpreted to establish what it means in the practical situation. We describe this as analysing the mathematical model to produce a mathematical solution.

Ordered pairs can be represented in a table like the one you completed in question 3 on the previous page. Ordered pairs can also be written in brackets: (input number; output number). For example, the ordered pairs you entered into the table in question 3 can be written as: (12; 62), (10; 52), (20; 102), (5; 27), (6; 32), (−5; −23), (−10; −48) 1.

His business is doing so well that he can no longer do all the work himself. He needs to get some help. Sibongile knows that one person can normally fill two jars in three days.

(b) How many jars can nine workers fill in a week? (c) How many workers does Sibongile need to produce 15 jars per week? (d) What are the two variables in the above situation? In a situation like the one above, one can have any number of jars, as well as fractions of a jar. One can have a whole number of jars (for example, four jars) or a fractional quantity of jars (for example, 6 2 or 4,45 jars). The other variable in the above situation, the number of full-time 3 ployees, is different. Only whole numbers of people are possible. Quantities like the quantity of jars of honey, which can include any fraction, are sometimes called “continuous quantities” or “continuous variables”. Quantities that can be counted, like a number of people or a number of motor cars or rivers or towns, are sometimes called “discrete quantities” or “discrete variables”. When a graph of a discrete variable is drawn, it does not normally make sense to join the dots with a line, but for some purposes it may be useful. 2.

The value of the dependent variable depends on the value given to the independent variable, hence its name. Sometimes there is no pattern to the relationship between the two variables and sometimes there is. In Grade 9 we will focus on graphs where there is a pattern to the relationship. Specifically, we will focus on graphs of linear functions. The graph of a linear function is a straight line.

G. (b) For each table, describe what you did to produce more output values. Also write down the rule (formula) that corresponds to the table. You may have noticed that the equations of straight lines look similar. The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c, where: • m tells us the gradient of the line • c tells us where the line crosses the y-axis • it is called the y-intercept and it has the coordinates (0; c) • the line y = 3x + 4 has a gradient of 3 and the y-intercept is (0 ; 4) • the equation of a line with a gradient of −2 and y-intercept of (0 ;10) is y = −2x + 10 • the line y = 2x has a gradient of 2 and the y-intercept is (0; 0) • the line y = 5 has a gradient of 0 and the y-intercept is (0; 5) What is the gradient and y-intercept of the line 2y = 6x + 10? If you said m = 6 and c = 10, you would be wrong. The equation is not in standard form. The equation must be written in standard form before you can read off the values of the gradient and the y-intercept. 2y = 6x + 10 ➝ Divide both sides by 2 y = 3x + 5 Therefore, the gradient is 3 and the y-intercept is (0; 5). 204 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 3 The standard form of a straight line graph is y = mx + c. On one side there should only be a “y” (with a coefficient of 1). gradient means the steepness or slope of the line. The point where a line crosses one of the axes is called the intercept. x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 y −10 −5 0 5 x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 y −5 −3 −1 x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 y 6 3 0 x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 y 3 2 1 0 x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 y 3 5 7 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 205 2017/04/13 2:29:22 PM If m > 0, the line will be increasing. If m < 0, the line will be decreasing. If the line is horizontal, m = 0. If the line is vertical, m is undefined. 2.

If you need to determine the equation of a straight line, then all you need to know are the values of m and c. If you know the values of two points on the graph, then you can determine the gradient using the formula: m = y A  y B x A  x B Once you know the gradient you can calculate the value of the y-intercept using substitution. Example 1: Determine the equation of the straight line that goes through (1; 1) and (5; 13). Step 1: Calculate the gradient. m = y A  y B = 1  13 = 12 = 3 x A  x B 1  5 4 Step 2: Since you now know m = 3 you can substitute it into the equation y = mx + c. Therefore, y = 3x + c. CHAPTER 18: GRAPHS 205 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 206 2017/04/13 2:29:22 PM Step 3: To determine c you need to substitute the coordinates of a point on the line into the equation. (It can be either of the points that were given, so choose the easier one.) Substitute (5; 13) into y = 3x + c (13) = 3(5) + c 13 = 15 + c 13 − 15 = c −2 = c Step 4: Write down the equation: y = 3x − 2.

It consists of a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis. The intersection of the axes is called the origin, and represents the point (0; 0). Any point can be represented on a coordinate system using an x-value and a y-value. These numbers are called coordinates, and describe the position of the point with reference to the two axes. The coordinates of a point are always written in a certain order: • The horizontal distance from the origin (x-coordinate) is written first. • The vertical distance from the origin (y-coordinate) is written second. • These numbers, called an ordered pair, are separated by a semi-colon (;) and are placed between brackets. Here is an example of an ordered pair: (4; 3) (see on the coordinate system above). • The x-axis and y-axis divide the coordinate system into four sections called quadrants. The diagram alongside shows how the quadrants are numbered, and also whether the x- and y-coordinates are negative or positive in each quadrant.

Copy the first coordinate system given on the previous page and plot the points in question 1 on it. When a point is translated to a different position on a coordinate system, the new position is called the image of the point. We use the prime symbol (') to indicate an image. For example, the image of A is indicated by A' (read as “A prime”). If the coordinates of A are labelled as (x; y), the coordinates of A' can be labelled as (x'; y'). We write A ➝ A' and (x; y) ➝ (x'; y') to indicate that A is mapped to A'. 20.2 Reflection (flip) The mirror image or reflection of a point is on the opposite side of a line of reflection. The original point and its mirror image are the same distance away from the line of reflection, and the line that joins the point and its image is perpendicular to the line of reflection. Any line on the coordinate system can be a line of reflection, including the x-axis, the y-axis and the line y = x. reflecting points in the x-axis, y-axis and the line y = x 1. The points A(5; 4) and B(−3; −2) are plotted on a coordinate system. Copy the coordinate system. (a) Reflect points A and B in the x-axis and write down the coordinates of the images.

We may write x' = x + p, with p > 0 for a translation to the right, and p < 0 for a translation to the left. The y-coordinate remains the same, so (x; y) → (x + p; y). • For a vertical translation through the distance q, the y-coordinate increases by the distance q if the slide is upwards, and decreases by the distance q if the slide is downwards. We may write y' = y + q, with q > 0 for a translation vertically upwards, and q < 0 for a translation vertically downwards. The x-coordinate remains the same, so (x; y) → (x; y + q).

You will remember the following from Grade 8: • An image is an enlargement or reduction of the original figure only if all the corresponding sides between the two figures are in proportion. This means that all the sides of the original figure are multiplied by the same number (the scale factor) to produce the image. • Scale factor = side length of image length of corresponding side of original figure º If the scale factor is > 1, the image is an enlargement. º If the scale factor is < 1, the image is a reduction. • The original figure and its enlarged or reduced image are similar. • Perimeter of image = Perimeter of original figure × scale factor • Area of image = Area of original figure × (scale factor) 2 nlargement b ultip ch side b 16 P = 48 units = 96 unit t t Reduction by h si iply each de t n 3 2 its u = 6 A s ni 2 u = 1 P 4 ) by si ult r m (o 5 2 by de ac e e vid Di 2 of tor fac a 2 1 6 s 2 ni 4 u = 2 A s ni 4 u = 2 P s 2 A 10 8 0 2 y 2 ea ly M 2 of tor fac a y E P = perimeter A = area CHAPTER 20: TRANSFORMATION GEOMETRY 227 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 228 2017/04/13 2:29:27 PM Sometimes the terminology used for enlargements and reductions can be confusing. Make sure you understand the following examples. Refer to the diagram on the previous page. “Enlarge a figure by a scale factor of 2” means: • side length of image = 2. length of corresponding side of original figure • Each side of the original figure must be multiplied by 2. • Each side of the image will be two times longer than its corresponding side in the original figure. • The perimeter of the image will be two times longer than the perimeter of the original figure. • The area of the image will be 2 2 times (2 × 2 = 4 times) bigger than the area of the original figure. “Reduce a figure by a scale factor of 2” means: • side length of image = 0,5. length of corresponding side of original figure • Each side of the original figure must be multiplied by 1 (or divided by 2). 2 • Each side of the image will be two times shorter than its corresponding side in the original figure. • The perimeter of the image will be two times shorter than the perimeter of the original figure. • The area of the image will be 2 2 times (2 × 2 = 4 times) smaller than the area of the original figure. (Or, area of image = ( 1 ) 2 = 1 of the area of the original figure.) 2 4 practise working with enlargements and reductions 1.

This point is known as the centre of enlargement or reduction. The centre of enlargement or reduction can be any point on the coordinate system. In this chapter, we will always use the origin as the centre of enlargement or reduction.

From the previous activity, you should have found the following: On a coordinate system, the line that joins the centre of an enlargement or reduction to a vertex of the original figure also passes through the corresponding vertex of the enlarged or reduced image. The coordinates of a vertex of the enlarged or reduced image are equal to the scale factor × the coordinates of the corresponding vertex of the original figure. For example: B(6; 4) → B' (3; 2): The coordinates of B' are 1 the coordinates of B. Note that the scale factor is 1 . 2 2 B(6; 4) → B'' (12; 8): The coordinates of B'' are two times the coordinates of B. Note that the scale factor is 2. In general, we therefore use the following notation to describe the enlargement or reduction with respect to the origin: (x; y) → (kx; ky) or (x'; y') = (kx; ky) where k is the scale factor. If 0 < k < 1, the image is a reduction. If k > 1, the image is an enlargement. Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 232 2017/04/13 2:29:28 PM practise 1.

You can use your knowledge about angles to prove that the five Platonic solids are the only 3D objects that can be made from identical regular polygons. Keep the following facts in mind: • A 3D object has at least three faces that meet at each vertex. • The sum of the angles that meet at a vertex must be less than 360°. If it is equal to 360°, it will form a flat surface. If it is greater than 360°, the faces will overlap. • Each Platonic solid is made up of one type of regular polygon only. What 3D objects can you make from equilateral triangles? We use the following reasoning: Size of each interior angle = 180° ÷ 3 = 60° ∴ three triangles = 3 × 60° = 180° [< 360°] four triangles = 4 × 60° = 240° [< 360°] five triangles = 5 × 60° = 300° [< 360°] six triangles = 6 × 60° = 360° Any more than five triangles will be equal to or more than 360° and will therefore form a flat surface or overlap. This means that we can make three 3D objects from equilateral triangles: • If three triangles are at each vertex, it will form a tetrahedron. • If four triangles are at each vertex, it will form an octahedron. • If five triangles are at each vertex, it will form an icosahedron. Tetrahedron Octahedron Icosahedron 239 CHAPTER 21: GEOMETRY OF 3d OBJECTS Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 240 2017/04/13 2:29:30 PM 240 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 3 What 3D objects can you make from squares? Complete the statements: Size of each interior angle ∴ three squares = 3 × four squares = 4 × Therefore, we can make only one 3D object using squares. This 3D object is called a hexahedron (or cube). What 3D objects can you make from regular pentagons? Complete the statements: Size of each interior angle ∴ three pentagons = four pentagons = Therefore, we can make only one 3D object using regular pentagons. This 3D object is called a dodecahedron. What 3D objects can you make from regular hexagons? Complete the statements: Size of each interior angle ∴ three hexagons = Hexahedron (cube) Dodecahedron Three hexagons will already form a flat surface. Therefore, it is impossible to make a 3D object from regular hexagons. Also, the interior angles of polygons with more than six sides are bigger than those of a hexagon, so it is not possible to make 3D objects from any other regular polygons. Therefore, the five Platonic solids already mentioned (tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, hexahedron and dodecahedron) are the only ones that can be made of identical regular polygons. Each of these solids is named after the number of faces it has.

This means that it is data that we can trust. Data cannot be trusted unless it has been collected in a way that makes sure that every member of the population had the same chance of being selected in the sample. It is not practical to taste all the oranges on a tree to know whether the oranges are sweet. Only a small number of oranges can be tested, otherwise the farmer would have too few oranges to sell. The oranges that are tested are called a sample, and all the oranges harvested from the tree are called the population. Sample bias occurs when the particular section of the population from which the sample is drawn does not represent that population. The way to avoid sample bias is to take a random sample. A sample is random if every member of the population has the same chance of being selected. A random sample of the orange trees means that every tree should have a chance of being selected for the sample. Every person in the country should have a chance of being selected for the housing survey in a random sample. An example of sample bias would be to survey only the people in Limpopo about their views on housing provision when you want to know the views of the whole country. For the sample to provide information on the population as a whole, each person in the country should have the same chance of being part of the survey. Data can be collected through questionnaires, through observation and through access to databases. How to develop a good questionnaire The questionnaire also has an important role in making sure that the information you collect is reliable. You should aim to get a high number of respondents and accurate information. If not enough people fill in the questionnaire, then you won’t know whether the information you get reflects the real situation. Sampling techniques and rules developed by statisticians determine the numbers needed. Chapter 22 Collect, organise and summarise data Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 250 2017/04/13 2:29:33 PM 250 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 There are some important points to consider when designing a questionnaire. Two of the most important points are that the questions are clear and accurate and that people find the questionnaire relatively easy to complete. 1. Keep in mind the length of the questionnaire and the time that it takes to complete. Your participants are more likely to complete a short questionnaire that is quick and easy to complete. Exclude unnecessary information. 2. Write down a selection of questions that you think will provide the information that you want. 3. Check the wording for each question. 4. Order the items so that they are in a logical sequence. It might make sense to have the easiest questions first, but in some cases the more general questions should come first and the more specific questions towards the end of the questionnaire. 5. Then try the questionnaire out on a partner. Ask the following questions: • Is this question necessary? What information will be provided by the answer? • How easy will it be for the respondent to answer this question? How much time will it take to answer the question? • Do the questions ask for sensitive information? Will people want to answer the question? Will the respondent answer the question honestly? • Can the question be answered quickly? 6. Decide how the answers should be provided. Questions may require open-ended responses or closed-ended responses, as described below. In an open-ended question, the person responds in his or her own words. Through his or her own words important information can be gained; the person is therefore free to write what he or she likes. A disadvantage is that you might not get the information you want and that it might take a long time to answer. In a closed-ended question, the respondents are given some options to choose from. They tick the box which most closely represents their response. These options can be constructed in categories. For example, age may be categorised as follows: Under 10 From 10 to 14 From 15 to 19 20 and older Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 251 2017/04/13 2:29:33 PM think about data collection and develop a questionnaire 1. Which method for collecting data would be most appropriate for each of the cases below? Give reasons for your choice. (a) The number of learners who bring lunch to school. What are the contents of the school lunch? (b) Whether or not the tellers at a supermarket chain are happy with their conditions of work. (c) Whether or not the clients of a clinic are satisfied with the professional conduct of the medical staff. (d) The types of activities preschool children choose during their free time. (e) The number of Grade 9 learners in the Gauteng North district. 2. You are doing some market research for a new fast-food shop near the high school. The owners of the shop want to find out what kind of food and music the target market likes. The target market is learners from the high school. Develop a questionnaire to collect this information. 22.2 Organising data There is a difference between data and information. Data is unorganised facts. When data is organised and analysed so that people can make decisions, it may be called information. Data can be organised in many different ways. Some methods are described below. Data can be organised by making a tally table. Here is an example of a tally table showing the numbers of learners in a class that participate in different sports: Sport Tally marks Soccer //// //// //// //// //// Athletics //// /// Netball //// //// //// //// / Chess //// / The above data can also be organised in a frequency table: Sport Frequency Soccer 25 Athletics 8 Netball 21 Chess 6 251 CHAPTER 22: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 252 2017/04/13 2:29:33 PM Numerical data sets with many items are often grouped into equal class intervals and represented in a table of frequencies for the different class intervals. This is very useful since it makes it easy to see how the data is spread out. Here is an example of grouped data showing the heights of all the learners in a school. To make a frequency table for numerical data, the data has to be arranged from smallest to biggest first. A stem-and-leaf display is a useful way to organise numerical data. It also shows you what the “shape” of the data is like. Here is an example of a stem-and-leaf display: Key: 35 | 4 means 354 34 0 4 35 4 8 8 36 0 1 6 8 37 1 3 5 8 8 8 9 38 2 4 9 39 0 3 4 4 5 6 9 40 0 3 7 41 1 The above stem-and-leaf display represents the following data about the masses in grams of the chickens in a sample of six-week-old chickens on a chicken farm: 399 378 382 360 396 389 344 411 378 394 394 354 375 378 400 371 379 358 366 403 358 395 390 340 393 384 361 407 373 368 To make a stem-and-leaf display, it helps to first arrange the data from smallest to largest, as shown on the next page, for the above data set. Height in m Number of learners (frequency) < 1,20 m 13 1,20 m – 1,30 m 28 1,30 m – 1,40 m 57 1,40 m – 1,50 m 164 1,50 m – 1,60 m 274 1,60 m – 1,70 m 198 1,70 m – 1,80 m 73 > 1,80 m 13 A value equal to the lower boundary of a class interval is counted in that interval. For example, a length of 1,60 m is counted in the interval 1,60 – 1,70, and not in the interval 1,50 – 1,60 m. However, 1,599 m is less than 1,60 m, so it belongs in the interval 1,50 m – 1,60 m. 252 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 253 2017/04/13 2:29:33 PM 340 344 354 358 358 360 361 366 368 371 373 375 378 378 378 379 382 384 389 390 393 394 394 395 396 399 400 403 407 411 The same data set is displayed in two slightly different ways below: In this display, the width of each class interval In this display, the width of is 10, as in the stem-and-leaf display above. each class interval is 15. working with grouped data 1.

(b) How many learner handspans are less than 21cm wide? (c) How many handspans are 18 cm or wider? (d) In which interval would you place a handspan of 18 cm? 22.3 Summarising data The mean, median, mode and range are single numbers that provide some information about a data set, without listing all the data values. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently. To find the mode, look for the number or category that is listed in the data set most often. Some data sets have more than one mode, and some may have none. The median is the number that separates the set of values into an upper half and a lower half. The median can be found by arranging the values from small to big or big to small. If the data set consists of an even number of items, the median is the sum of the two middle values divided by 2. The mean (average) of a set of numerical data is the sum of the values divided by the number of values in the data set. Mean = the sum of the values ÷ the number of values. The range is a number that tells us how spread out the data values are. It is the difference between the largest and smallest values. The mean, median and mode do not work equally well for all sets of data. It depends on the kind of data, and also on whether the data is evenly spread out or not. organise, summarise and compare some data 1.

Discuss the spread of the data in each case, and compare the three different groups. Work and report on your work. 2. Copy the table and fill in the statistic (mode, mean or median) that would best summarise each data set, and indicate the central tendency of the data: Data set Best measure of central tendency The shoe sizes of boys in Grade 9 An evenly spread set of measurement values, such as the heights of learners in a class A set of measurement values with a few very low values and mostly high values The number of siblings each person in your class has The sizes of properties in a town, where most people live in small apartments or RDP houses, and a few live on large properties extreme values and outliers An extreme value or outlier is a data value that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. Sometimes there are reasons why this data value is so different to the others. It is important to comment on the possible reasons. When you are summarising data (and also when you analyse data), you need to decide whether or not an outlier makes sense in the context you are looking at. It is possible that an outlier does not make sense, as it lies too far away and is an unreasonable measurement. Then you need to think about the fact that this data value may be an error. For example: 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 age 255 CHAPTER 22: COLLECT, ORGANISE ANd SUMMARISE dATA Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 256 2017/04/13 2:29:33 PM In this case, the value of 24 years old could be an unreasonable value. This depends on the context of the survey. You will learn more about extreme values and outliers in Chapter 24.

The following table summarises some of the data: Percentage of population that is overweight and obese 1980 2008 Sub-Saharan Africa 12% 23% North Africa and Middle East 33% 58% Latin America 30% 57% East Asia (low-income countries) 13% 25% Europe 45% 58% North America (high-income countries) 43% 70% (a) The table summarises “some” of the data. What would some other important data be? Think of as many things as you can. (b) Which data stands out the most for you in the table above? Give your personal opinion. (c) On grid paper, plot a double bar graph to compare the data for the areas, and for the two years. Remember to give your graph a key. (d) Look carefully at the comparisons that the graph makes. Has your opinion of the most interesting differences changed, now that you see the double bar graph?

Write a short report on the data and your double bar graph to support this argument. 23.2 Histograms revising histograms A histogram is a graph of the frequencies of data in different class intervals, as demonstrated in the example on the following page. Each class interval is used for a range of values. The different class intervals are consecutive and cannot have values that overlap. The data may result from counting or from measurement. A histogram looks somewhat like a bar graph, but is normally drawn without gaps between the bars. representing data in histograms 1. (a) A fruit farmer wants to know which of his trees are producing good plums and which trees need to be replaced. He collects 100 plums each from two trees and measures their masses. The data below gives the mass of plums from the first tree: Mass of plums (g) 20–29 30–39 40–49 50–59 60–69 Frequency 6 18 34 30 12 Use the example below to represent the data in a histogram. (b) Now draw another histogram to represent the following data giving the mass of the same type of plums from another tree in the orchard: Mass of plums (g) 20–29 30–39 40–49 50–59 60–69 Frequency 3 14 26 36 21 259 CHAPTER 23: REPRESENTING dATA Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 260 2017/04/13 2:29:34 PM 260 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 (c) Study the two histograms and then comment on the number of plums produced by the two trees. 2.

(c) Records from the whole country show that the birth weight of babies ranges from 0,5 kg to 4,5 kg, and the mean birth weight is 3,18 kg. Use the graph and the mean and median to write a short report on the data from the clinic. 23.3 Pie charts A pie chart consists of a circle divided into sectors (slices). Each sector shows one category of data. Bigger categories of data have bigger slices of the circle. Here is an example of a pie chart: This pie chart shows Customer opinion on service at Fishy Fun restaurant as reflected in survey 5% or 1 five categories of data. The size of each slice is the fraction or percentage of the whole that the category forms.

For example, the rainfall for a whole month is captured as one data point, even though the rain is spread out over the month, and it rains on some days and not on others. Broken line graphs are useful to identify and display trends. Here is some data that can be represented with broken-line graphs: Rainfall at three locations in South Africa in 2012 Amatole, KZN Mahikeng, NW Ceres, WC Rainfall (mm) Rainfall (mm) Rainfall (mm) January 101 118 27 February 108 90 23 March 117 86 41 April 77 61 60 May 46 14 130 June 27 6 168 July 32 3 152 August 48 7 162 September 76 18 88 October 112 46 60 November 115 75 41 December 100 86 36 Here is a broken line graph for the Amatole rainfall data: Rainfall for Amatole, KZN 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Months 262 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 Rainfall (mm) January February March April May June July August September October November December Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 263 2017/04/13 2:29:34 PM 1.

Write a few lines on the difference in rainfall patterns between Ceres and Mahikeng. 8. Draw a combined broken-line graph with the information from all three regions on one graph. 23.5 Scatter plots understanding and constructing scatter plots Scatter plots show how two sets of numerical data are related. Matching pairs of numbers are treated as coordinates and are plotted as a single point. All the points, made up of two data items each, show a scattering across the graph. 1. This table shows a data set with two variables. Study the information in the table. 2. Copy the number lines on the next page and make a dot for each learner’s mark for each subject. 263 CHAPTER 23: REPRESENTING dATA Learners Mathematics marks Natural Sciences marks Zinzi 25 26 John 23 25 Palesa 22 25 Siza 21 23 Eric 20 23 Chokocha 19 21 Gabriel 17 20 Simon 16 19 Miriam 15 18 Frederik 15 16 Sibusiso 12 15 Meshack 11 13 Duma 11 12 Samuel 10 12 Lola 10 11 Thandile 9 10 Jabulani 8 10 Manare 7 9 Marlene 7 7 Mary 5 7 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 264 2017/04/13 2:29:34 PM Natural Sciences marks 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 Mathematics marks 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 3.

Learners who obtain a high mark for Mathematics appear to obtain a low mark for Art. We say there is a negative correlation between the Mathematics and Art scores for this data set. A correlation is an assessment of how strongly two sets of data appear to be connected. Two sets of data may be correlated or may show no correlation.

You have learnt that certain types of graphs are best for displaying certain kinds of information. The type of graph depends mostly on the type of data that needs to be represented. Here is a summary of the advantages of different types of graphs: Tables show more information than graphs but the patterns are not as easy to see. They do not give a visual impression of particular trends. Pie charts show a whole divided into parts. They show how the parts relate to each other and how the parts relate to a whole. They do not show the quantities involved. Bar graphs show the amounts or quantities involved but do not show the relationship as effectively as pie charts. They are useful for showing quantitative data. Bar charts allow us to compare the quantities of different categories, for example, the sales of different items. A double-bar graph is used to compare two or more things for each category. For example, we could use a double-bar graph to compare the differences between males and females. Histograms are used to represent numerical data that is grouped into equal class intervals. Histograms are useful to show the way the data is spread out. Broken-line graphs show trends or changes in quantities over time.

The articles might not use the exact terms for average that you have learnt about: the mean, median and mode. Instead, they may use terms such as “most”. However, it is important to be sure about the kind of average to which a report refers, because an average gives us different information. • Remember that the mean is useful for describing a set of measurement values, but can also be used for other numerical data sets. The word “average” usually refers to the “mean” if it is not explained further. The mean is not reliable if a data set is too spread out. • The median is the value in the middle of a data set when it is arranged in order. Half the values in the data set are lower than the median and half of them are higher than the median. The median is often the average used when data values are not uniformly distributed, because the mean is affected by extreme values in the data set, while the median is not. For example, house prices vary widely, so the median would be a better description of the data than the mean. When the median is given in a report, the writer should state that he or she is using the median or middle value. • The mode is the number that occurs most often in a set of data. For example, if we collect data about people’s favourite colours, the data set would be a list of colours, and the mode would be the colour that comes up most often. The mode can also be used for numbers. Not all data sets have a mode, because sometimes none of the numbers occurs more than once. Example: The standard way of reporting house prices in South Africa and internationally is the median house price, which is used by economists in financial reports. The median is regarded as more useful than the mean house price because the sale of a few expensive houses would increase the mean, but would not affect the median. If a bank gives bonds for eight houses to the value of R100 000, and for two houses to the value of R1 million, then the mean would be R280 000. This does not seem to be an accurate reflection of the value of the houses, because it is distorted by the higher values. The median house price would be R100 000, which is an accurate reflection of the prices. Remember that the median is the middle point, and half of the values fall below the median, and half above. If the median is lower than the mean, this shows us that there are high values that are distorting the mean. 272 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 273 2017/04/13 2:29:35 PM using different summary statistics 1.

(b) Which summary statistic gives a better idea of the salaries at the company? Give reasons for your answer. 24.3 Misleading graphs The media (i.e. newspapers, magazines and television), regularly use graphs to show information. Unfortunately, the information is often manipulated to emphasise a particular result. This may be because the writer simply wants to make his or her argument more obvious to the reader. Changing the scale of the axis If you change the scale of the vertical axis on bar graphs and line graphs, you will change the way the graphs look. For a bar graph, the larger the spaces between the numbers on the vertical axis, the bigger the difference between the bars. The smaller the spaces between the numbers on the axis, the smaller the difference in the height of the bars. The same is true for a line graph which will either have sharp points or be much flatter, depending on how you have changed the scale. Example: The two broken-line graphs on the next page show the same sales data for a business over a period of six months. Which graph gives the more accurate impression? 273 CHAPTER 24: INTERPRET, ANALYSE ANd REPORT ON dATA Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 274 2017/04/13 2:29:35 PM Graph A Graph B Graph B has a different scale on the vertical axis. The vertical axis does not start at 0 and so two blocks on the vertical axis represent 100 items instead of only one block, as in Graph A. This makes it look as if the sales increased rapidly over the six months. Note that it is not necessarily wrong to change the scale on the axes or not to start at 0. For example, graphs showing stock exchange fluctuations rarely show the origin on the graph and stockbrokers are taught to interpret the graphs in that form. Sometimes small changes in data values have important effects and in these cases, it may be valid to change the scale to show these. 274 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 A S Mont O N h D J r) mbe ece y to D s (Jul Sale 700 650 600 550 500 450 400 350 0 A S Mont O N h D J r) mbe ece y to D s (Jul Sale Quantity Quantity Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 275 2017/04/13 2:29:35 PM analysing graphs 1.

The scatter plot on the previous page shows the performance of a group of learners in Mathematics and History. Which of the points on the scatter plot can be regarded as outliers? Give reasons for your answer. Outliers in data sets can be very important. We need to decide if there is a particular reason for the value being so different to the others. Sometimes it gives us important information. In some cases, the data collected for that point could be wrong. The scatter plot below is for data collected by a transport company.

Before each transport job, the company has to specify the price for the job. In order to specify a price before a job, the company needs to estimate how much their costs will be for doing the job. One of the main costs is the cost of fuel, and the main factor influencing the amount of fuel used is the distance. The load weight also plays a role: the greater the load weight, the higher the fuel consumption (litres/100 km). The table on the next page gives information that was recorded for previous transport jobs.

(a) Suppose the eight coloured buttons above are in a bag and you draw one button from the bag without looking. Can you tell what colour you will draw? (b) Suppose you repeatedly draw a button from the bag, note its colour, then put it back. Can you tell in approximately what fraction of all the trials the button will be yellow? Archie has a theory. Because the eight possible outcomes are equally likely, he believes that if you perform eight trials in a situation like the above you will draw each colour once. 2. If Archie’s theory is correct, how many times will each colour be drawn if 40 trials are performed? 3. If Archie’s theory is correct, in what fraction of the total number of trials will each colour be drawn? 4. If Archie’s theory is correct, how many times will each of the colours be drawn if a total of 40 trials is performed? Copy the table on the following page and write your answers in the second row of the table. Write the predicted relative frequencies in row 3 as fortieths, and in row 4 as two hundredths. yellow green pink blue red brown grey black Each time you draw a button from the bag without looking, you perform a trial. If you do this and put the button back, and repeat the same actions eight times, you have performed eight trials. The number of times an event occurs during a set of trials is called the frequency of the event. When the frequency of an event is expressed as a fraction of the total number of trials, it is called the relative frequency.

If all the outcomes are equally likely, then: probability of an outcome = 1 the total number of equally - likely outcomes You will now investigate whether or not Archie’s theory is correct. 5. (a) Make eight small cards and write the name of one of the above colours on each card, so that you have cards with the eight colour names. Perform eight trials to check whether or not Archie’s theory is correct. Copy the table below and record your results (your tally marks 1 and your frequencies 1) in the relevant row of the table.

Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 282 2017/04/13 2:29:36 PM 7. Is Archie’s theory correct? Bettina has a different theory to Archie’s. She believes that if one does many trials with the eight buttons in a bag, each colour will be drawn in approximately one-eighth of the cases. In other words, Bettina believes that the relative frequency of each outcome will be close to the probability of that outcome, but may not be equal to it. 8. (a) You and your four classmates performed 40 trials in total. Copy the table below and enter the results in the second row of the table. Also express each frequency as a fraction of 40, in fortieths and in two hundredths. Colour Yellow Green Pink Blue Red Brown Grey Black Actual frequencies obtained in your experiments (40 trials) Relative frequencies as fortieths Relative frequencies as two hundredths Probability as two hundredths (b) Do your experiments show that Bettina’s theory is correct or not? Jayden believes that when more trials are performed, the relative frequencies will get closer to the probabilities. You will now do an investigation to find out whether Jayden’s theory is true. investigate what happens when more trials are done 1. Perform 40 trials by drawing one card at a time from eight small cards with the names of the colours written on them, and enter your results in the second and third rows of a table like the one shown below.

Make a copy of the table on page 282, but leave out the row for tally marks, the row for the relative frequencies as fortieths and the row for the probabilities, on a loose sheet of paper. Exchange it with a classmate. Copy the following Tables 1 and 2 and enter the results of your classmate on Table 1 and 2. Also enter your own results for question 1 on the tables. 3. Get hold of the data reports of three other classmates, and enter these on the tables as well. 4. Add the frequencies of the various colours in the five sets of data for 40 trials each, and calculate the relative frequencies expressed as two hundredths. 5. Is the range of relative frequencies for 200 trials smaller than the ranges for the five different sets of 40 trials each? What does this indicate with respect to Jayden’s theory? When only a small number of trials are done, the actual relative frequencies for different outcomes may differ a lot from the probabilities of the outcomes. When many trials are done, the actual relative frequencies of the different outcomes are quite close to the probabilities of the outcomes.

How many different three-digit numbers can be formed with the symbols 3 and 5, if no other symbols are used? You may use one, two or three of the symbols in each number, and you may repeat the same symbol. 25.2 Compound events tossing a coin and giving birth 1. Simon threw a coin and the outcome was heads. He will now throw the coin again. (a) What are the possible outcomes? (b) What is the probability of each of the possible outcomes? (c) What are the possible outcomes if Simon throws the coin for a third time? (d) What is the probability of each of the possible outcomes for the third throw? What happens when a coin is thrown for a second time has nothing to do with what happened when it was thrown the first time. The first throw and the second throws are called independent events, i.e. what happened on the first throw cannot influence what will happen on the second throw. 2. (a) If an event has four different equally-likely outcomes, what is the probability of each of the four outcomes? (b) Does that mean that if the event is repeated four times, each of the four outcomes will happen once? (c) Does your answer in (a) mean that if the event is repeated 100 times, each of the four outcomes will happen 25 times? 284 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 285 2017/04/13 2:29:36 PM 3.

Heads Tails Heads H T Tails (b) Do you think these four outcomes are equally likely? (c) What is the probability of each of the four outcomes? (d) What is the probability of getting a head and a tail? 4. Let us consider the possible outcomes if three coins are thrown. Below is a tree diagram that can help you figure out what the different possible outcomes are. Complete the diagram by filling in the missing information. First coin Second coin Third coin Outcome heads heads tails heads tails heads tails HHH HHT HTH HTT tails 5. (a) Do you think the eight different outcomes in question 4 are equally likely? (b) What is the probability of each of the eight outcomes? (c) What is the probability of throwing two heads and one tail? 6. In question 6 on page 284 you were asked to write down the various numbers that can be formed by using symbols 3 and 5. Think of all the four-letter codes that you can form by using only two letters, P and Q. Any letter can be used more than once in one code. First think about how you will go about finding all the possibilities in a systematic way, and then try to set up a tree diagram to help you. 285 CHAPTER 25: PROBABILITY Maths_Gr9_LB_book.indb 286 2017/04/13 2:29:36 PM 286 MATHEMATICS GRAdE 9: TERM 4 (a) Draw a tree diagram to help you to solve this problem. List all the outcomes. (b) If the codes are formed by randomly choosing the letters, what is the probability that the code will consist of the same letter being used four times? (c) What is the probability that the code will consist of two Ps and two Qs? When a woman is pregnant, the baby can be a boy or a girl. Suppose we make the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely, so the probability of a boy is 1 and the probability of a girl is 1 . 2 2 7. (a) Copy and complete this two-way table to show the possible outcomes of the gender of the two children in a family. Boy Girl (b) List the possible outcomes. (c) What is the probability that the two children in the family will be of the same gender? (d) What is the probability that the eldest child will be a boy and that they will then have a girl? 8. A certain woman already has a boy. She now expects a second child. What is the probability of it being a boy again, if we make the assumption that a baby being a boy or a girl are equally likely events? 9. (a) A woman gets married and plans to have a baby in one year and another baby in the next year. What is the probability that both babies will be girls? (b) A woman gets married and plans to have a baby in each of the first three years of the marriage. What is the probability that she will have a boy in the first year, and girls in the second and third years? The assumption that a boy or a girl being born are equally likely events may not actually be true. However, probabilities can only be calculated and used to make predictions if it is assumed that outcomes are equally likely.
